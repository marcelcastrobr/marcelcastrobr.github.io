        "- Familiar Jupyter experience - Get the full power of a Jupyter Python notebook environment, directly connected to the governed Snowflake data. \n",
        "- Full IDE features: Easy editing and file management for maximum productivity.\n",
        "- Powerful for AI/ML: Runs in a pre-built container environment optimized for scalable AI/ML development with fully-managed access to CPUs and GPUs, parallel data loading, distributed training APIs for popular ML packages (e.g. xgboost, pytorch, lightGBM).\n",

        "- workloads managed by Snowflake: notebooks, model serving, and ML jobs.\n",

        "- Job services. A job service terminates when your code exits, similar to a stored procedure.\n",
