    "# How Attention Mechanism works in Transformers\n",
    "\n",
    "The attention mechanism is an operator that was introduced as part of the Transformer architecture by the paper entitled [\"Attention is All You Need\"](https://arxiv.org/abs/1706.03762).\n",
    "\n",
    "As highligthed by [Attention Mechanisms and Transformers](https://d2l.ai/chapter_attention-mechanisms-and-transformers/index.html), the intuition behind attention is that rather than compressing the input, it might be better for the decoder to revisit the input sequence at every step. \n",
    "\n",
    "Moreover, rather than always seeing the same representation of the input, one might imagine that the decoder should selectively focus on particular parts of the input sequence at particular decoding steps. \n",
    "\n",
    "The high-level idea is that the encoder could produce a representation of length equal to the original input sequence. Then, at decoding time, the decoder can (via some control mechanism) receive as input a context vector consisting of a weighted sum of the representations on the input at each time step. Intuitively, the weights determine the extent to which each step’s context “focuses” on each input token, and the key is to make this process for assigning the weights differentiable so that it can be learned along with all of the other neural network parameters.\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook was created to better understand the attention mechanism in Transformers using PyTorch. The code examples here are inspired by [Let's build GPT: from scratch, in code, spelled out by Andrej Karpathy](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kCc8FmEb1nY).\n",

    "Important remarks from Andrej:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Attention is a **communication mechanism**. Can be seen as nodes in a directed graph looking at each other and aggregating information with a weighted sum from all nodes that point to them, with data-dependent weights.\n",
    "\n",
    "- There is no notion of space. Attention simply acts over a set of vectors. This is why we need to positionally encode tokens.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Each example across batch dimension is of course processed completely independently and never \"talk\" to each other\n",
    "\n",
    "- \"self-attention\" just means that the keys and values are produced from the same source as queries. In \"cross-attention\", the queries still get produced from x, but the keys and values come from some other, external source (e.g. an encoder module)\n",
    "\n",
    "- \"Scaled\" attention additional divides `wei` by 1/sqrt(head_size). This makes it so when input Q,K are unit variance, wei will be unit variance too and Softmax will stay diffuse and not saturate too much. "
