<h1>Thinking Tokens</h1>
<p><strong>Thinking tokens</strong> concept (also known as reasoning tokens) enables more intelligence to large models during inference. Until now, the rule to get more intelligent models was only possible through pre-training large model following the “scaling laws”, i.e.&nbsp;adding more training data and computing to pretrain large models.</p>
<p>Now with the concept of “thinking tokens” you can achieve more intelligence with the introduction of an internal model reasoning while doing the next token prediction.</p>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>&lt;|startofthought|&gt; and &lt;|endofthought|&gt;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The idea of thinking tokens has been introduced by some authors such as <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.09629">Quiet-STaR: Language Models Can Teach Themselves to Think Before Speaking</a> and latest <a href="https://platform.openai.com/docs/guides/reasoning">o1 model</a> from OpenAI. Thinking tokens are named reasoning tokens by OpenAI.</p>
<p>The basic concept is to generate “thinking tokens” at inference time to help model to predict next token. A key challenge is to efficiently generate rationales at each token position in the input sequence. However, as pointed out by simply creating a separate forward pass for each token would be computationally intractable for longer sentences.</p>
<div class="quarto-figure quarto-figure-center">

<p>According to authors, this is done at the inference pass of a language model, when it produces the probability distribution over the next tokens for all input tokens. The solution in Quiet-STaR implements it by <em>caching each forward pass and concatenating a diagonal attention mask to the previous attention mask. Thus each generated token attends to all of the tokens that were used to generate it, as well as itself.</em> But it does not consider the token on the other “counterfactual” paths.</p>

<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>Interestingly, not all tokens requires equal amount of thought .</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Interestingly, not all tokens requires equal amount of thought . Thus the thinking token technique does not benefit all tokens equally. For example the sentence “<strong>the person is run-</strong>”, the “<strong>ing</strong>” is most probably the token with highest probability and there the additional thinking is unlike to improve a well-trained prediction model.</p>
<p>Thus complex reasoning task such as GSM8K are the ones that would benefit more from the thinking token technique.</p>

<p>Results:</p>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>Amount of thinking tokens increase the accuracy of the models.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>As show in figure below, more thinking tokens improve the GSM8K accuracy as the training steps icreases.</p>

OpenAI o1-model).</p>
<p><img src="./assets/image-20241014104857732.png" alt="image-20241014104857732" style="zoom:50%;"></p>
<p>Based on <a href="https://github.com/GAIR-NLP/O1-Journey?tab=readme-ov-file">O1 Replication Journey: A Strategic Progress Report by Qin et. al</a>, the following approaches are relevant when trying to answer the question.</p>
<p><strong>Process-level Reward Model:</strong> provide fine-grained evaluations of responses from LLMs, specially in mathematical reasoning. The PRMs technique assess model correctness while enhancing post-training quality through search methods such as Monte Carlo Tree Search.</p>
<p><strong>Chain of Thought (CoT) Theory</strong>: CoT has advanced reasoning capabilities of LLMs, as intermediate reasoning steps has enhanced LLM performance on tasks such as arithmetic and common sense reasoning. According to researchers, CoT empowers decoder-only models as it enabled inherently serial computations.</p>
<p><strong>Internal Thought</strong>: Represents the capability of LLMs to reflect on their reasoning and refinement of its outputs. <strong>Quiet-STaR</strong> is an approach which following the “Internal Thought” solution by training language models to generate rationales after each token, helping them predict and explain future text more effectively. The work of <a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2406.12050">Zhang et. al (2024)</a> introduces the embedding reflection within each training instance, which encourage the models to review their decisions and consider alternatives paths.</p>

<p><strong>Inference Time Scaling:</strong> the idea is that scaling inference time can provide more efficient model performance in comparison the current scaling laws theorem (i.e.&nbsp;increase of number of parameters and training data volume to increase model intelligence). By allowing model more time to process and refine their outputs during inference an alternative scaling dimension appears providing resource efficiency and adaptable computation and consequently reasoning improvements through step-by-step interactive refinement.</p>
<p><strong>Search-to-thought</strong>: CoT has gained attention as it improve performance by generating intermediate reasoning steps without search. <a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2311.01460">Implicit Chain-of-Thought Reasoning</a> bypass the need for generating explicit reasoning steps as it can relies on internal hidden states of the model. This is done by using knowledge distilled from a teacher model - training to generate intermediate steps, and allowing student models to solve tasks more efficiently by reasoning vertically through their internal layers (Ref. <a href="https://github.com/GAIR-NLP/O1-Journey?tab=readme-ov-file">O1 Replication Journey: A Strategic Progress Report by Qin et. al</a>).</p>

<p><strong>Self-improvement in LLM:</strong> those methods rely on model learning from its outputs without human intervention. Examples are Supervised Fine Tunning (SFT) and preference optimization such as DPO. Here the quality of the model is a function of the external reward system in the form of a reward model, human evaluator or LLM-as-a-Judge prompting. However, <em>finding has suggested that LLM-generated texts often exhibit truncated “tails” - i.e.&nbsp;the distribution of generated output lacks variability found in human-generated content, and can lead to model collapse phenomenon (model converging to a narrower range of behaviors and harming performance</em>) (ref. <a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2305.17493">Shumailov, et. al.&nbsp;(2024)</a>).</p>
<section id="chain-of-thought-cot-differences" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="chain-of-thought-cot-differences">Chain of Thought (CoT) Differences</h3>
<p>Some differences highlighted by Quiet-STaR authors (<a href="https://community.openai.com/t/papers-quiet-star-language-models-can-teach-themselves-to-think-before-speaking/686158/3">here</a>) while comparing thinking tokens to CoT are:</p>
<ul>
<li>Different from CoT, model is trained using RL (reinforcement learning) to generate more useful thoughts.</li>
<li>Rewards model used to generate inner monologues that helps to predict text instead of answers to specific questions - less domain specific.</li>
</ul>
<p>As pointed by OpenAI <a href="https://platform.openai.com/docs/guides/reasoning/advice-on-prompting">here</a> CoT might undermine “thinking tokens”. Thus a best practice are:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Avoid chain-of-thought prompts:</strong> Since these models perform reasoning internally, prompting them to “think step by step” or “explain your reasoning” is unnecessary.</li>
<li><strong>Limit additional context in retrieval-augmented generation (RAG):</strong> When providing additional context or documents, include only the most relevant information to prevent the model from overcomplicating its response.</li>

<h4 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="mcts-monte-carlo-tree-search">**MCTS (Monte Carlo Tree Search):</h4>
<p>The Monte Carlo Tree Search enhance the reasoning capability of the model and it is integrated in the model as following:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Nodes as reasoning states:</strong> each node represents a reasoning state of the problem-solving process.</li>
<li><strong>Actions as LLM outputs</strong>: the possible actions from a node are the LLM generated outputs. Each output is a potential step or mini-step in the reasoning chain.</li>
<li><strong>Rollout and reward calculation</strong>: during rollout, the LLM continues the reasoning to a terminal state.</li>
<li><strong>Guiding MCTS</strong>: the reward score R is used to evaluate and select promising paths within the MCTS, guiding the search towards a reliable reasoning chains.</li>
</ul>
<p>Figure above show <strong><em>v</em></strong>, the average confidence score across all tokens to derive the overall <strong>reward score</strong>. Where n is the total number of tokens in the rollout sequence. A higher v indicates a more confident and accurate reasoning path.</p>
<p>The confidence score of each state <em>c</em> is calculated by applying a softmax function to its log probability and the log probabilities of the top 5 alternative tokens. Thus <em>ci</em> is the confidence score for the ith token in the rollout. <span class="math display">\[
c_{i} = \frac{exp(p(t_{i}))}{\sum_{k=1}^{5}{exp(p(t_{k}))}}

<section id="reasoning-action-strategies" class="level4">
<h4 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="reasoning-action-strategies">Reasoning Action Strategies:</h4>
<p>Reasoning action strategies is implemented to allow different levels of granularity in the MCTS search. For example, the concept of <strong>mini-steps</strong> represents a search space in MCTS in steps composed by smaller units of 64 or 32 tokens. According to authors, it is impractical due to computational resources to execute token level search.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>step as action</strong>: model generate complete reasoning steps as actions, where each MCTS node represents an entire thought or action label.</li>
<li><strong>Mini-step as action</strong>: mini-steps of 32 or 64 tokens used as action giving finer granularity to expand the solution space and improve model ability to reasoning tasks by considering mode nuances steps in the search process.</li>
</ul>
<p>A reflection mechanism “<strong><em>Wait! Maybe I made some mistakes! I need to rethink from scratch.</em></strong>” is added at the end of each though process. This allow the model to self reflect and reevaluate its reasoning steps. As described by <a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2411.14405v2">authors</a>, the reflection step serves as an internal feedback loop allowing the model to self correct without external intervention.</p>

<p>See the whole though process from QnQ 32B preview here:</p>
<pre><code>Let's tackle this problem step by step. The equation given is:

1 + 2 * 3 + 4 * 5 + 6 * 7 + 8 * 9 = 479

But it's incorrect, and I need to add a pair of parentheses to make it true. Okay, first things first, I should understand what the current value of the left side is without any parentheses.

Let's recall the order of operations: PEMDAS (Parentheses, Exponents, Multiplication and Division, Addition and Subtraction). So, multiplication comes before addition.

So, calculating step by step:

2 * 3 = 6

4 * 5 = 20

6 * 7 = 42

8 * 9 = 72

Now, adding them up with the 1:

1 + 6 + 20 + 42 + 72

Let's add these up:

1 + 6 = 7

7 + 20 = 27

27 + 42 = 69

69 + 72 = 141

So, without any parentheses, the left side equals 141, but we need it to equal 479. That's quite a difference, so I definitely need to add parentheses to change the order of operations.

I need to think about where to place the parentheses to get the desired result. Parentheses can group operations together, so whatever is inside the parentheses is calculated first.

Let me consider different possibilities:

Option 1: Parenthesize the entire left side.

(1 + 2 * 3 + 4 * 5 + 6 * 7 + 8 * 9)

But that's the same as without parentheses, which gives 141, not 479.

Option 2: Group some of the additions and multiplications.

For example, (1 + 2) * 3 + 4 * 5 + 6 * 7 + 8 * 9

Calculate inside the parentheses first:

(1 + 2) = 3

Then, 3 * 3 = 9

Now, add the rest:

9 + 4 * 5 + 6 * 7 + 8 * 9

Following order of operations:

4 * 5 = 20

6 * 7 = 42

8 * 9 = 72

Now, add them up:

9 + 20 + 42 + 72

9 + 20 = 29

29 + 42 = 71

71 + 72 = 143

Still not 479.

Option 3: Try grouping differently.

(1 + 2 * 3) + 4 * 5 + 6 * 7 + 8 * 9

First, calculate inside the parentheses:

1 + 2 * 3

Remember, multiplication comes before addition, so 2 * 3 = 6, then 1 + 6 = 7

Now, the equation becomes:

7 + 4 * 5 + 6 * 7 + 8 * 9

Following order of operations:

4 * 5 = 20

6 * 7 = 42

8 * 9 = 72

Now, add them up:

7 + 20 + 42 + 72

7 + 20 = 27

27 + 42 = 69

69 + 72 = 141

Still not 479.

Option 4: Group more terms inside the parentheses.

(1 + 2 * 3 + 4) * 5 + 6 * 7 + 8 * 9

First, calculate inside the parentheses:

1 + 2 * 3 + 4

Again, multiplication first: 2 * 3 = 6

Then, 1 + 6 + 4 = 11

Now, multiply by 5: 11 * 5 = 55

Then, add the rest:

55 + 6 * 7 + 8 * 9

Following order of operations:

6 * 7 = 42

8 * 9 = 72

Now, add them up:

55 + 42 + 72

55 + 42 = 97

97 + 72 = 169

Still not 479.

Option 5: Try grouping differently.

1 + 2 * (3 + 4) * 5 + 6 * 7 + 8 * 9

First, calculate inside the parentheses:

3 + 4 = 7

Then, 2 * 7 = 14

Now, multiply by 5: 14 * 5 = 70

So, the equation becomes:

1 + 70 + 6 * 7 + 8 * 9

Following order of operations:

6 * 7 = 42

8 * 9 = 72

Now, add them up:

1 + 70 + 42 + 72

1 + 70 = 71

71 + 42 = 113

113 + 72 = 185

Still not 479.

Option 6: Keep trying different groupings.

1 + 2 * 3 + 4 * (5 + 6) * 7 + 8 * 9

First, calculate inside the parentheses:

5 + 6 = 11

Then, 4 * 11 = 44

Then, 44 * 7 = 308

Now, the equation becomes:

1 + 2 * 3 + 308 + 8 * 9

Following order of operations:

2 * 3 = 6

8 * 9 = 72

Now, add them up:

1 + 6 + 308 + 72

1 + 6 = 7

7 + 308 = 315

315 + 72 = 387

Still not 479.

Option 7: Try another grouping.

1 + 2 * 3 + 4 * 5 + 6 * (7 + 8) * 9

First, calculate inside the parentheses:

7 + 8 = 15

Then, 6 * 15 = 90

Then, 90 * 9 = 810

Now, the equation becomes:

1 + 2 * 3 + 4 * 5 + 810

Following order of operations:

2 * 3 = 6

4 * 5 = 20

Now, add them up:

1 + 6 + 20 + 810

1 + 6 = 7

7 + 20 = 27

27 + 810 = 837

Now, 837 is greater than 479, but still not equal to it.

Hmm, maybe I need to think differently. Perhaps grouping the additions together.

Option 8: Group additions first.

(1 + 2) * 3 + 4 * 5 + 6 * 7 + 8 * 9

Wait, I think I already did this in Option 2, which gave 143, not 479.

Option 9: Group differently.

1 + (2 * 3 + 4 * 5 + 6 * 7 + 8 * 9)

First, calculate inside the parentheses:

2 * 3 = 6

4 * 5 = 20

6 * 7 = 42

8 * 9 = 72

Now, add them up: 6 + 20 + 42 + 72 = 140

Then, add 1: 1 + 140 = 141

Still not 479.

Option 10: Try nesting parentheses.

1 + 2 * (3 + 4 * (5 + 6) * 7) + 8 * 9

Wait, but the problem says to add only one pair of parentheses. So, I should stick to adding just one pair.

Option 11: Maybe group subtractions or something, but the equation only has additions and multiplications.

Wait, perhaps I need to group in a way that multiplication affects a larger expression.

Option 12: Try (1 + 2 * 3 + 4 * 5 + 6) * 7 + 8 * 9

First, calculate inside the parentheses:

1 + 2 * 3 + 4 * 5 + 6

Following order of operations:

2 * 3 = 6

4 * 5 = 20

So, 1 + 6 + 20 + 6 = 33

Now, multiply by 7: 33 * 7 = 231

Then, add 8 * 9: 231 + 72 = 303

Still not 479.

Option 13: Try (1 + 2 * 3 + 4 * 5 + 6 * 7) + 8 * 9

First, calculate inside the parentheses:

1 + 2 * 3 + 4 * 5 + 6 * 7

Following order of operations:

2 * 3 = 6

4 * 5 = 20

6 * 7 = 42

Now, add them up: 1 + 6 + 20 + 42 = 69

Then, add 8 * 9: 69 + 72 = 141

Still not 479.

Option 14: Maybe group from the other end.

1 + 2 * 3 + 4 * 5 + (6 * 7 + 8 * 9)

First, calculate inside the parentheses:

6 * 7 = 42

8 * 9 = 72

Then, add them: 42 + 72 = 114

Now, the equation becomes:

1 + 2 * 3 + 4 * 5 + 114

Following order of operations:

2 * 3 = 6

4 * 5 = 20

Now, add them up: 1 + 6 + 20 + 114 = 141

Still not 479.

Option 15: Maybe I need to group more terms inside the parentheses.

(1 + 2 * 3 + 4 * 5 + 6 * 7 + 8) * 9

First, calculate inside the parentheses:

1 + 2 * 3 + 4 * 5 + 6 * 7 + 8

Following order of operations:

2 * 3 = 6

4 * 5 = 20

6 * 7 = 42

Now, add them up: 1 + 6 + 20 + 42 + 8 = 77

Then, multiply by 9: 77 * 9 = 693

Now, 693 is larger than 479, but still not equal to it.

Hmm, maybe I need to think outside the box. Perhaps the parentheses need to encompass a subtraction or something, but there are no subtractions in the original equation.

Wait, perhaps I can consider inserting parentheses in a way that changes the order of operations dramatically.

Option 16: (1 + 2) * (3 + 4) * (5 + 6) * (7 + 8) * 9

But that would be more than one pair of parentheses, which violates the problem's condition of adding only one pair.

Option 17: Maybe group additions and multiplications differently.

1 + 2 * (3 + 4 * 5 + 6 * 7 + 8 * 9)

First, calculate inside the parentheses:

3 + 4 * 5 + 6 * 7 + 8 * 9

Following order of operations:

4 * 5 = 20

6 * 7 = 42

8 * 9 = 72

Now, add them up: 3 + 20 + 42 + 72 = 137

Then, multiply by 2: 2 * 137 = 274

Finally, add 1: 1 + 274 = 275

Still not 479.

Option 18: Try (1 + 2 * 3 + 4 * 5 + 6 * 7 + 8) * 9

Wait, I think I did this in Option 15, which gave 693, not 479.

Option 19: Maybe group differently.

1 + (2 * 3 + 4 * 5 + 6 * 7 + 8 * 9)

Calculate inside the parentheses:

2 * 3 = 6

4 * 5 = 20

6 * 7 = 42

8 * 9 = 72

Now, add them up: 6 + 20 + 42 + 72 = 140

Then, add 1: 1 + 140 = 141

Still not 479.

Option 20: Maybe consider grouping additions first.

(1 + 2) * 3 + 4 * 5 + 6 * 7 + 8 * 9

Wait, did I not do this in Option 2? Yes, it gave 143.

Option 21: Try a different approach.

Perhaps I need to group in a way that multiplication affects a larger expression to get a bigger number closer to 479.

Option 22: (1 + 2 * 3 + 4 * 5 + 6 * 7 + 8 * 9)

Wait, that's the same as without parentheses, which is 141.

Option 23: Maybe group only part of the expression.

1 + 2 * (3 + 4 * 5 + 6 * 7 + 8 * 9)

First, calculate inside the parentheses:

3 + 4 * 5 + 6 * 7 + 8 * 9

Following order of operations:

4 * 5 = 20

6 * 7 = 42

8 * 9 = 72

Now, add them up: 3 + 20 + 42 + 72 = 137

Then, multiply by 2: 2 * 137 = 274

Finally, add 1: 1 + 274 = 275

Still not 479.

Option 24: Try grouping fewer terms.

(1 + 2 * 3) + 4 * 5 + 6 * 7 + 8 * 9

Did this in Option 3, which gave 141.

Option 25: Maybe group the last few terms.

1 + 2 * 3 + 4 * 5 + 6 * (7 + 8 * 9)

First, calculate inside the parentheses:

7 + 8 * 9

Following order of operations: 8 * 9 = 72, then 7 + 72 = 79

Now, multiply by 6: 6 * 79 = 474

Then, the equation becomes:

1 + 2 * 3 + 4 * 5 + 474

Following order of operations:

2 * 3 = 6

4 * 5 = 20

Now, add them up: 1 + 6 + 20 + 474 = 501

Now, 501 is closer to 479, but still not it.

Option 26: Maybe adjust the grouping slightly.

1 + 2 * 3 + 4 * (5 + 6 * 7 + 8 * 9)

First, calculate inside the parentheses:

5 + 6 * 7 + 8 * 9

Following order of operations:

6 * 7 = 42

8 * 9 = 72

Now, add them up: 5 + 42 + 72 = 119

Then, multiply by 4: 4 * 119 = 476

Now, the equation becomes:

1 + 2 * 3 + 476

Following order of operations:

2 * 3 = 6

Now, add them up: 1 + 6 + 476 = 483

Close to 479, but still not there.

Option 27: Maybe group differently to get closer.

1 + 2 * 3 + 4 * (5 + 6 * 7 + 8) * 9

First, calculate inside the parentheses:

5 + 6 * 7 + 8

Following order of operations:

6 * 7 = 42

Then, 5 + 42 + 8 = 55

Now, multiply by 4: 4 * 55 = 220

Then, multiply by 9: 220 * 9 = 1980

Now, the equation becomes:

1 + 2 * 3 + 1980

Following order of operations:

2 * 3 = 6

Now, add them up: 1 + 6 + 1980 = 1987

Way beyond 479.

Option 28: Maybe try to subtract somewhere, but there are no subtractions in the original equation.

Wait, perhaps I need to consider that the parentheses might force a subtraction somehow, but that seems unlikely.

Option 29: Let's try to target the multiplication that gives the biggest boost.

Maybe group 6 * (7 + 8 * 9)

First, calculate inside the parentheses:

7 + 8 * 9

Following order of operations: 8 * 9 = 72, then 7 + 72 = 79

Now, multiply by 6: 6 * 79 = 474

Now, the equation becomes:

1 + 2 * 3 + 4 * 5 + 474

Following order of operations:

2 * 3 = 6

4 * 5 = 20

Now, add them up: 1 + 6 + 20 + 474 = 501

Still not 479.

Option 30: Maybe group 4 * (5 + 6 * 7 + 8 * 9)

First, calculate inside the parentheses:

5 + 6 * 7 + 8 * 9

Following order of operations:

6 * 7 = 42

8 * 9 = 72

Now, add them up: 5 + 42 + 72 = 119

Then, multiply by 4: 4 * 119 = 476

Now, the equation becomes:

1 + 2 * 3 + 476

Following order of operations:

2 * 3 = 6

Now, add them up: 1 + 6 + 476 = 483

Still not 479.

Option 31: Maybe adjust the grouping to get closer.

1 + 2 * (3 + 4 * 5 + 6 * 7 + 8 * 9)

First, calculate inside the parentheses:

3 + 4 * 5 + 6 * 7 + 8 * 9

Following order of operations:

4 * 5 = 20

6 * 7 = 42

8 * 9 = 72

Now, add them up: 3 + 20 + 42 + 72 = 137

Then, multiply by 2: 2 * 137 = 274

Finally, add 1: 1 + 274 = 275

Still not 479.

Option 32: Maybe group larger expressions.

(1 + 2 * 3 + 4 * 5 + 6 * 7 + 8) * 9

Did this in Option 15, which gave 693.

Option 33: Perhaps consider that I need to group in a way that creates a larger multiplication factor.

Option 34: Try (1 + 2 * 3 + 4 * 5 + 6) * (7 + 8 * 9)

But that would be more than one pair of parentheses.

Option 35: Maybe group differently.

1 + (2 * 3 + 4 * 5 + 6 * 7 + 8 * 9)

Did this in Option 19, which gave 141.

Option 36: Maybe consider that I need to group additions in a specific way to control the multiplication impact.

Option 37: Try (1 + 2 * 3 + 4 * 5 + 6 * 7) + (8 * 9)

But that would be two pairs of parentheses, which is not allowed.

Option 38: Maybe think about the difference between the current sum and the desired sum.

Currently, without any parentheses, the sum is 141, and we need 479.

The difference is 479 - 141 = 338.

Is there a way to add parentheses such that the value increases by 338?

Option 39: Perhaps look for a multiplication factor that can amplify some part of the expression to cover this difference.

Option 40: Maybe consider that multiplying a larger grouped expression could help reach the target.

Option 41: Let's try (1 + 2 * 3 + 4 * 5 + 6) * 7 + 8 * 9

First, calculate inside the parentheses:

1 + 2 * 3 + 4 * 5 + 6

Following order of operations:

2 * 3 = 6

4 * 5 = 20

Now, add them up: 1 + 6 + 20 + 6 = 33

Then, multiply by 7: 33 * 7 = 231

Finally, add 8 * 9: 231 + 72 = 303

Still not 479.

Option 42: Try (1 + 2 * 3 + 4 * 5) + 6 * 7 + 8 * 9

First, calculate inside the parentheses:

1 + 2 * 3 + 4 * 5

Following order of operations:

2 * 3 = 6

4 * 5 = 20

Now, add them up: 1 + 6 + 20 = 27

Then, add 6 * 7: 6 * 7 = 42

27 + 42 = 69

Finally, add 8 * 9: 69 + 72 = 141

Still not 479.

Option 43: Maybe group the additions first.

(1 + 2) * 3 + 4 * 5 + 6 * 7 + 8 * 9

Did this in Option 2, which gave 143.

Option 44: Try (1 + 2 * 3 + 4) * 5 + 6 * 7 + 8 * 9

Did this in Option 4, which gave 169.

Option 45: Maybe group further.

(1 + 2 * 3 + 4 * 5 + 6 * 7) + 8 * 9

Did this in Option 13, which gave 141.

Option 46: Perhaps consider that I need to group in a way that allows for a larger multiplication.

Option 47: Try 1 + 2 * (3 + 4 * 5 + 6 * 7 + 8 * 9)

Did this in Option 17, which gave 275.

1 + 2 * 3 + 4 * (5 + 6 * 7 + 8 * 9)

Did this in Option 26, which gave 483.

Option 49: Perhaps try to group 5 + 6 * 7 + 8 * 9.

Wait, that's part of the previous option.

Option 50: Maybe consider that I need to group in a way that allows for subtraction implicitly.

Wait, but there are no subtractions in the original equation.

Option 51: Maybe think about factoring or some algebraic manipulation.

Option 52: Let's consider the target value, 479, and see how we can reach it.

Option 53: Maybe I need to group in a way that creates a multiplication that results in a number close to 479.

Option 54: Try (1 + 2 * 3 + 4 * 5 + 6 * 7 + 8 * 9)

Wait, that's the same as without parentheses, which is 141.

Option 55: Maybe consider that I need to group the additions and multiplications in a specific order to maximize the value.

Option 56: Try (1 + 2 * 3 + 4 * 5 + 6) * 7 + 8 * 9

Did this in Option 12, which gave 303.

Option 57: Maybe group differently.

Did this in Option 19, which gave 141.

Option 58: Perhaps consider that I need to group the multiplications together.

Option 59: Try 1 + 2 * (3 + 4) * 5 + 6 * 7 + 8 * 9

Did this in Option 5, which gave 185.

Option 62: Maybe I need to think about exponents, but there are no exponents in the original equation.

Option 63: Perhaps consider that the parentheses need to be placed in a way that changes the order of operations drastically, like grouping additions before multiplications.

Option 64: Try (1 + 2) * (3 + 4) * (5 + 6) * (7 + 8) * 9

But that would require multiple pairs of parentheses, which is not allowed.

Option 65: Maybe consider that the parentheses need to be placed around a subtraction, but there are no subtractions.

Option 66: Perhaps think about negative numbers, but there are no negative numbers in the original equation.

Option 67: Maybe consider that I need to group in a way that creates a larger addition before multiplication.

Option 68: Try 1 + 2 * (3 + 4 * 5 + 6 * 7 + 8 * 9)

Did this in Option 17, which gave 275.

Option 69: Maybe group differently.

1 + (2 * 3 + 4 * 5 + 6 * 7 + 8) * 9

First, calculate inside the parentheses:

2 * 3 + 4 * 5 + 6 * 7 + 8

Following order of operations:

2 * 3 = 6

4 * 5 = 20

6 * 7 = 42

Now, add them up: 6 + 20 + 42 + 8 = 76

Then, multiply by 9: 76 * 9 = 684

Finally, add 1: 1 + 684 = 685

Now, 685 is larger than 479, but still not equal to it.

Option 70: Maybe adjust the grouping.

1 + 2 * (3 + 4 * 5 + 6 * 7 + 8) * 9

First, calculate inside the parentheses:

3 + 4 * 5 + 6 * 7 + 8

Following order of operations:

4 * 5 = 20

6 * 7 = 42

Now, add them up: 3 + 20 + 42 + 8 = 73

Then, multiply by 2: 2 * 73 = 146

Then, multiply by 9: 146 * 9 = 1314

Finally, add 1: 1 + 1314 = 1315

Way beyond 479.

Option 71: Maybe try to group fewer terms.

(1 + 2 * 3 + 4 * 5 + 6 * 7 + 8 * 9)

Wait, that's the same as without parentheses, which is 141.
