    "text": "Thinking tokens concept (also known as reasoning tokens) enables more intelligence to large models during inference. Until now, the rule to get more intelligent models was only possible through pre-training large model following the “scaling laws”, i.e. adding more training data and computing to pretrain large models.\nNow with the concept of “thinking tokens” you can achieve more intelligence with the introduction of a model reasoning while doing the next token prediction.\n\n&lt;|startofthought|&gt; and &lt;|endofthought|&gt;\n\nThe idea of thinking tokens has been introduced by some authors such as Quiet-STaR: Language Models Can Teach Themselves to Think Before Speaking, o1 model from OpenAI and latest DeepSeek-R1. Thinking tokens are named reasoning tokens by OpenAI.\nThe basic concept is to generate “thinking tokens” at inference time to help model to predict next token. A key challenge is to efficiently generate rationales at each token position in the input sequence. However, as pointed out by simply creating a separate forward pass for each token would be computationally intractable for longer sentences.\n\n\n\nimage-20241002100759413\n\n\nPicture: Quiet-STaR\nAccording to authors, this is done at the inference pass of a language model, when it produces the probability distribution over the next tokens for all input tokens. The solution in Quiet-STaR implements it by caching each forward pass and concatenating a diagonal attention mask to the previous attention mask. Thus each generated token attends to all of the tokens that were used to generate it, as well as itself. But it does not consider the token on the other “counterfactual” paths.\n\n\n\nimage-20241002101133078\n\n\n\nInterestingly, not all tokens requires equal amount of thought .\n\nInterestingly, not all tokens requires equal amount of thought . Thus the thinking token technique does not benefit all tokens equally. For example the sentence “the person is run-”, the “ing” is most probably the token with highest probability and there the additional thinking is unlike to improve a well-trained prediction model.\nThus complex reasoning task such as GSM8K are the ones that would benefit more from the thinking token technique.\n\n\n\nimage-20241002101210020\n\n\nResults:\n\nAmount of thinking tokens increase the accuracy of the models.\n\nAs show in figure below, more thinking tokens improve the GSM8K accuracy as the training steps icreases.\n\n\n\nimage-20241002100915950\n\n\n\n\nCan LLMs learn to think before they speak is a question that several researchers are exploring in order to generate robust internal reasoning processes targeting both training and inference (ref. OpenAI o1-model).\n\nBased on O1 Replication Journey: A Strategic Progress Report by Qin et. al, the following approaches are relevant when trying to answer the question.\nProcess-level Reward (PRM) Model: provide fine-grained evaluations of responses from LLMs, specially in mathematical reasoning. The PRMs technique assess model correctness while enhancing post-training quality through search methods such as Monte Carlo Tree Search.\nChain of Thought (CoT) Theory: CoT has advanced reasoning capabilities of LLMs, as intermediate reasoning steps has enhanced LLM performance on tasks such as arithmetic and common sense reasoning. According to researchers, CoT empowers decoder-only models as it enabled inherently serial computations.\nInternal Thought: Represents the capability of LLMs to reflect on their reasoning and refinement of its outputs. Quiet-STaR is an approach which following the “Internal Thought” solution by training language models to generate rationales after each token, helping them predict and explain future text more effectively. The work of Zhang et. al (2024) introduces the embedding reflection within each training instance, which encourage the models to review their decisions and consider alternatives paths.\n\n\n\nimage-20241014101904756\n\n\nSource: Zhang et. al (2024)\nInference Time Scaling: the idea is that scaling inference time can provide more efficient model performance in comparison the current scaling laws theorem (i.e. increase of number of parameters and training data volume to increase model intelligence). By allowing model more time to process and refine their outputs during inference an alternative scaling dimension appears providing resource efficiency and adaptable computation and consequently reasoning improvements through step-by-step interactive refinement.\nSearch-to-thought: CoT has gained attention as it improve performance by generating intermediate reasoning steps without search. Implicit Chain-of-Thought Reasoning bypass the need for generating explicit reasoning steps as it can relies on internal hidden states of the model. This is done by using knowledge distilled from a teacher model - training to generate intermediate steps, and allowing student models to solve tasks more efficiently by reasoning vertically through their internal layers (Ref. O1 Replication Journey: A Strategic Progress Report by Qin et. al).\n\n\n\nimage-20241014103154723\n\n\nSource: Implicit Chain-of-Thought Reasoning\nSelf-improvement in LLM: those methods rely on model learning from its outputs without human intervention. Examples are Supervised Fine Tunning (SFT) and preference optimization such as DPO. Here the quality of the model is a function of the external reward system in the form of a reward model, human evaluator or LLM-as-a-Judge prompting. However, finding has suggested that LLM-generated texts often exhibit truncated “tails” - i.e. the distribution of generated output lacks variability found in human-generated content, and can lead to model collapse phenomenon (model converging to a narrower range of behaviors and harming performance) (ref. Shumailov, et. al. (2024)).\n\n\nSome differences highlighted by Quiet-STaR authors (here) while comparing thinking tokens to CoT are:\n\nDifferent from CoT, model is trained using RL (reinforcement learning) to generate more useful thoughts.\nRewards model used to generate inner monologues that helps to predict text instead of answers to specific questions - less domain specific.\n\nAs pointed by OpenAI here CoT might undermine “thinking tokens”. Thus a best practice are:\n\nAvoid chain-of-thought prompts: Since these models perform reasoning internally, prompting them to “think step by step” or “explain your reasoning” is unnecessary.\nLimit additional context in retrieval-augmented generation (RAG): When providing additional context or documents, include only the most relevant information to prevent the model from overcomplicating its response.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMarco-o1 is inspired by OpenAI o1 and leverages different techniques such as:\n\nCoT (Chain of Thought) fine-tuning\nMCTS (Monte Carlo Tree Search): allow exploration of multiple reasoning paths using confidence scores derived from softmax-applied log probability of the top-k alternative tokens.\nReasoning Action Strategies: allow to vary granularity of actions within steps and mini-steps to optimize search efficiency and accuracy -\n\nMarco-o1 is a fine tuning of Qwen2-7B-Instruct with a combination of filtered Open-O1 CoT dataset, Marco-o1 CoT dataset and Marco-o1 instruction dataset.\n\n\n\nimage-20241202094701319\n\n\nPicture from Marco-o1\n\n\nThe Monte Carlo Tree Search enhance the reasoning capability of the model and it is integrated in the model as following:\n\nNodes as reasoning states: each node represents a reasoning state of the problem-solving process.\nActions as LLM outputs: the possible actions from a node are the LLM generated outputs. Each output is a potential step or mini-step in the reasoning chain.\nRollout and reward calculation: during rollout, the LLM continues the reasoning to a terminal state.\nGuiding MCTS: the reward score R is used to evaluate and select promising paths within the MCTS, guiding the search towards a reliable reasoning chains.\n\nFigure above show v, the average confidence score across all tokens to derive the overall reward score. Where n is the total number of tokens in the rollout sequence. A higher v indicates a more confident and accurate reasoning path.\nThe confidence score of each state c is calculated by applying a softmax function to its log probability and the log probabilities of the top 5 alternative tokens. Thus ci is the confidence score for the ith token in the rollout. \\[\nc_{i} = \\frac{exp(p(t_{i}))}{\\sum_{k=1}^{5}{exp(p(t_{k}))}}\n\\]\n\n\n\nReasoning action strategies is implemented to allow different levels of granularity in the MCTS search. For example, the concept of mini-steps represents a search space in MCTS in steps composed by smaller units of 64 or 32 tokens. According to authors, it is impractical due to computational resources to execute token level search.\n\nstep as action: model generate complete reasoning steps as actions, where each MCTS node represents an entire thought or action label.\nMini-step as action: mini-steps of 32 or 64 tokens used as action giving finer granularity to expand the solution space and improve model ability to reasoning tasks by considering mode nuances steps in the search process.\n\nA reflection mechanism “Wait! Maybe I made some mistakes! I need to rethink from scratch.” is added at the end of each though process. This allow the model to self reflect and reevaluate its reasoning steps. As described by authors, the reflection step serves as an internal feedback loop allowing the model to self correct without external intervention.\n\n\n\n\nQwen with Questions (QwQ) from Alibaba is a strong open-source competitor to OpenAI’s GPT-o1 reasoning model.

    "section": "",
    "text": "Basic knowledge of Python.\nAccess to Amazon SageMaker Jumpstart.\n\n\n\nMixture of Experts (MoE) idea dates back to 2010, where it has been explored for example in SVMs and Gaussian Process (ref. Learning Factored Representations in a Deep Mixture of Experts). Lately is has incorporated in LSTM with the introduction of sparsity (i.e. to allow running only parts of the whole neural network) (ref. Switch Transformers).\nThe general idea of MoE is to replicate certain model components many times while routing each input only to a small subset of those replicas (a.k.a. experts). MoEs achieve faster inference for same model quality at the expense of significatly higher memory cost as all replicated components (a.k.a. parameter) need to be loaded in memory.\nMixture of Experts (MoE) consists of the main two elements:\n\n\nInstead of using dense feed-forward network (FFN), MoE makes use of sparse MoE layers known as “experts”. As show in picture below, each expert is a neural network.\n\n\n\nIn an MoE, the router determines which tokens are sent to which experts. The router is complsed by the learned parameters and its pre-trained at the same time as the rest of the network.\n\n\n\nmoe\n\n\n\n\n\nThe conditional computation on MoE where parts of the network are active on a per-token basis, allow us to scale the size of the model without increasing the computation.\n\n\n\nAs described by Mixture of Experts Explained by HuggingFace, MoE comes with some challenges:\n\nTraining: MoEs enable significantly more compute-efficient pretraining, but they’ve historically struggled to generalize during fine-tuning, leading to overfitting.\nHigh memory requirement at inference: Although a MoE might have many parameters, only some of them are used during inference. This leads to fast inference compared to a dense model with same number of parameters. But, ALL parameters need to be loaded in RAM, so memory requirements are high. This is a disadvantage for MoE in edge devices as memory size is restricted.\n\n\n\n\nQMoE: Practical Sub-1-Bit Compression of Trillion-Parameter Models) proposed a new compression framework called QMoE which uses quantization as a way to compress trillion-parameters MoEs to less than 1 bit per parameter. Basically quantization converst the parameters (a.k.a model weights) to lower numerical precision (e.g. going from 16bits - half precision to 4 bits per weight.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEvery transformer layer has 8 experts and they are permuted in each layer. Instead of 8 experts what we have is a 256 independent experts in total accross the layers (32 x 8).\n\n\n\nIn reallity there are not 56B (8x7B) but 46.7B as the gating and attention layers are shared among the experts. Thus each token will see 12.9B active parameters instead of 14B parameters.\n\n\n\nMixtral 8x7B has fewer active parameters than Llama2 13B. But by having expert routing in MoE you have a higher communication cost as you need to send tokens to different experts. Thus the cost and amount of active parameters are NOT proportiona in MoE.\nNote that in MoE you can not program which token you send to which expert. Thus while gaining on performance/cost, the absolute cost is not proportional to the amount of active parameters.\n\n\n\n\nToBeDefine\n\n\n\nThis notebook is inspired by Amazon SageMaker Jumpstart notebooks, which uses SageMaker Python SDK to deploy Mixtral 8x7B text generation model.\nWe use the instance ml.g5.48xlarge which contains 8 x NVIDIA A10g with a total 192 GB memory.\n\nimport sagemaker\n\nprint(sagemaker.__version__) # 2.214.3\n\nsagemaker.config INFO - Not applying SDK defaults from location: /etc/xdg/sagemaker/config.yaml\nsagemaker.config INFO - Not applying SDK defaults from location: /home/sagemaker-user/.config/sagemaker/config.yaml\n2.221.0\n\n\n\n#!pip install --upgrade sagemaker #2.221.0\n\n\nfrom sagemaker.jumpstart.model import JumpStartModel\n\n\nmodel_id = \"huggingface-llm-mixtral-8x7b-instruct\" #\"huggingface-llm-mistral-7b-instruct\" #\naccept_eula = True\n\n\n\nWe deploy Mixtral 8x7B using Amazon SageMaker Jumpstart.

    "section": "",
    "text": "The attention layer is the main bottleneck in scaling longer sequences in LLM (Large Language Models), as its runtime and memory increase quadratically in the sequence length [ref. FlashAttention-2].\nFor each attention head, to reduce memory reads/writes, FlashAttention uses classical tiling techniques to load blocks of query, key, and value from GPU HBM (its main memory) to SRAM (its fast cache), compute attention with respect to that block, and write back the output to HBM. This reduction in memory reads/writes brings significant speedup (2-4x) in most cases. [ref. https://www.adept.ai/blog/flashier-attention]\nThe figure below is from FlashAttention paper showing on the left that FlashAttention uses tiling to prevent materialization of the large 𝑁 × 𝑁 attention matrix (dotted box) on (relatively) slow GPU HBM.\nHere in the outer loop (red arrows), FlashAttention loops through blocks of the K and V matrices and loads them to fast on-chip SRAM. In each block, FlashAttention loops over blocks of Q matrix (blue arrows), loading them to SRAM, and writing the output of the attention computation back to HBM.\nOn the right you see the speedup over the PyTorch implementation of attention on GPT-2. FlashAttention does not read and write the large 𝑁 × 𝑁 attention matrix to HBM, resulting in an 7.6× speedup on the attention computation according to the paper.\n\n\n\nimage-20240507155528488\n\n\nThis notebook has the objective to compared the benefits of the flash attention versus normal attentional mechanism using pytorch implementation of scaled dot product attention .\nThis notebook is inspired by the following work: - https://github.com/Dao-AILab/flash-attention - https://github.com/thushv89/tutorials_deeplearninghero/blob/master/llms/flash_attention_torch.ipynb\n\n\nFirst let´s install the required package and versions.

    "section": "",
    "text": "Visual ChatGPT connects ChatGPT and a series of Visual Foundation Models to enable sending and receiving images during chatting.\nChatGPT is a language interface with distinctive conversational competency and reasoning capabilities across many domains. However, it is currently unable to process or generate images from the visual world. To address this limitation, the authors propose a system called Visual ChatGPT that incorporates different Visual Foundation Models to enable users to interact with ChatGPT using both language and images. The system is capable of handling complex visual questions or instructions that require multiple AI models and steps. Additionally, it allows for feedback and corrections.\nRather than creating a new multimodal ChatGPT from scratch, the authors propose building Visual ChatGPT by incorporating various (22) Visual Foundation Models (VFMs) directly into ChatGPT. To facilitate the integration of these VFMs, the authors introduce a Prompt Manager that supports several functions. These include specifying the input-output formats of each VFM, converting visual information to language format, and managing the histories, priorities, and conflicts of different VFMs. With the Prompt Manager’s help, ChatGPT can use these VFMs iteratively and receive their feedback until it satisfies the users’ requirements or reaches the end condition.\nPaper: https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.04671\nCode link: https://github.com/microsoft/visual-chatgpt\nA detailed unofficial overview of the paper: https://andlukyane.com/blog/paper-review-palme\nThis notebook from https://github.com/microsoft/visual-chatgpt.\nDownload visual-chatgpt\n\n!rm -rf visual-chatgpt && git clone https://github.com/microsoft/visual-chatgpt\n\nCloning into 'visual-chatgpt'...\nremote: Enumerating objects: 163, done.\nremote: Counting objects: 100% (91/91), done.\nremote: Compressing objects: 100% (39/39), done.\nremote: Total 163 (delta 63), reused 60 (delta 52), pack-reused 72\nReceiving objects: 100% (163/163), 9.56 MiB | 18.30 MiB/s, done.\nResolving deltas: 100% (83/83), done.\n\n\nGo to directory\n\ncd visual-chatgpt/\n\n/content/visual-chatgpt\n\n\nInstall packages\n\n!pip install -r requirements.txt\n\nSet your OPENAI_API_KEY\n\n%env OPENAI_API_KEY=&lt;YOURKEY&gt;\n\nImport dependencies\n\nfrom visual_chatgpt import *\n\n/usr/local/lib/python3.9/dist-packages/flax/core/frozen_dict.py:169: FutureWarning: jax.tree_util.register_keypaths is deprecated, and will be removed in a future release.

    "text": "AI Agents\n\n\nIn the context of Large Language Models (LLMs), AI Agents are autonomous software entities designed to extend the capabilities of LLMs.\nRecently , we have seen several agent frameworks such as AutoGen, CrewAI and LangGraph and examples such as AutoGPT and BabyAGI.\nThese solutions leverage LLM capabilities and typically consist of the following steps:\n\n📄 Task decomposition: break complex tasks into smaller, manageable steps.\n⚒️ Tool integration: LLM interacting with various tools and APIs to gather data from the environment, such as web scraping tools, calculator and python interpreter.\n📚 Memory: used to retain information from past interactions, allowing to provide more context information.\n💱 Autonomous execution: once plan is established, the agent can execute the steps autonomously.\n\nThese steps make AI agents powerful as they extend the functionality of LLMs beyond simple generation tasks towards autonomous task execution. For example, ReAct (Reasoning and Acting) is a common methodology applied to AI agents to improve performance by leveraging reasoning and acting capabilities.\n\n\n\nReAct\n\n\nPicture by Shunyu Yao - LLM Agents - Brief History and Overview\n\n\nSo far, AI agent frameworks have needed to communicate with the outside world through tool integration in the form of APIs. However, today Anthropic announced a new approach—LLMs performing tasks directly on your computer.\nThis is possible using computer use capability available in Claude 3.5 sonnet and Claude 3.5 Haiku.\n\nAvailable today on the API, developers can direct Claude to use computers the way people do—by looking at a screen, moving a cursor, clicking buttons, and typing text. Claude 3.5 Sonnet is the first frontier AI model to offer computer use in public beta. At this stage, it is still experimental — at times cumbersome and error-prone. We’re releasing computer use early for feedback from developers, and expect the capability to improve rapidly over time.\n\nAccording to Anthropic, instead of creating specific tools to help Claude complete individual tasks, we’re teaching it general computer skills—allowing it to use a wide range of standard tools and software programs designed for people.\nExamples of Anthropic’s computer use capability include:\n\nCreating an entire website on the user’s computer and even fixes bugs in the code [here].\nUsing data from user’s computer and online data to fill out forms [here].\nOrchestrating a multi-step task by searching the web, using native applications, and creating a plan with the resulting information [here].\n\nFigure below shows the prompt for the example “Using data from user’s computer and online data to fill out forms” from youtube video: Computer use for automating operations.\n\n\n\nAnthropic’s Computer Use\n\n\nPicture by Anthropic’s new computer use tool from Youtube Computer use for automating operations video.\n\n\n\n\nThis section is based on my notes from the presentation given by Manjeet Singh, Salesforce on the SMALLCON conference by Predibase in Dec. 2024.\n\nImportant things to consider while building Production-ready AI agents based on steps provided above:\n\n📄 Task decomposition: Topics\n⚒️ Tool integration: Sources, knowledge quality, guardrails\n📚 Memory: User context, page context\n💱 Autonomous execution: actions, intent, latency\n\nIn addition, as highlight by Manjeet Singh, Salesforce customer trust on the agent is important, and common points below need to be considered:\n❗ Data privacy and security concerns: e.g. legal\n❗ ​lack of confidence in accuracy: “how this will behave in production? I am getting different answer each time”\n❗ ​negative past experience: “I tried before and it did not work”\n❗ ​ROI and cost concerns: “how to calculate business value?”\n\n\n\nimage-20250110082320573\n\n\nPicture by Manjeet Singh, Salesforce\nAs in in software development best practice, the agent development follows similar steps, which are:\n➡️ Ideate ➡️ Setup ➡️ Configure ➡️ Test ➡️ Deploy ➡️ Monitor 🔁\n\n\n\nimage-20250110083443875\n\n\nPicture by Manjeet Singh, Salesforce\n\n\nTesting and evaluation during agent application development is very important.\nAs in all generative AI usecase, the journey normally looks like this:\n➡️ Select a pre-trained LLM (e.g. gpt-4o or claude 3.5)\n➡️ Prompt Engineering (improve prompt with few shots)\n➡️ Prompt Engineering + RAG (longer prompts, slower inference)\n➡️ Advanced techniques (advanced RAG, finetuning - improve speed, quality and cost)\nHere is an example from Manjeet Singh, Salesforce to atomate agent evaluation.\n\n\n\nimage-20250110084935905\n\n\nPicture by Manjeet Singh, Salesforce\nBelow is an example of evaluation while considering a RAG (Retrieval Augmented Generation) pipeline.\n\n\n\nimage-20250110085416224\n\n\nPicture by Manjeet Singh, Salesforce\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAgent Evaluations\n\n\nPicture by Philipp Schimid\n\n\n\n\nAI Agents: Key Concepts and How They Overcome LLM Limitations by TheNewStack\nIntroducing computer use, a new Claude 3.5 Sonnet, and Claude 3.5 Haiku by Anthropic (20241022)\nBerkley Course: Large Language Model Agents by Dawn Song\nThe AI agents have arrived by Casey Newton\nWhen you give a Claude a mouse by Ethan Mollick\nLLM Powered Autonomous Agents | Lil’Log\nAgents by Chip Huyen"

We’re releasing computer use early for feedback from developers, and expect the capability to improve rapidly over time.\n\nAccording to Anthropic, instead of creating specific tools to help Claude complete individual tasks, we’re teaching it general computer skills—allowing it to use a wide range of standard tools and software programs designed for people.\nExamples of Anthropic’s computer use capability include:\n\nCreating an entire website on the user’s computer and even fixes bugs in the code [here].\nUsing data from user’s computer and online data to fill out forms [here].\nOrchestrating a multi-step task by searching the web, using native applications, and creating a plan with the resulting information [here].\n\nFigure below shows the prompt for the example “Using data from user’s computer and online data to fill out forms” from youtube video: Computer use for automating operations.\n\n\n\nAnthropic’s Computer Use\n\n\nPicture by Anthropic’s new computer use tool from Youtube Computer use for automating operations video."

I am getting different answer each time”\n❗ ​negative past experience: “I tried before and it did not work”\n❗ ​ROI and cost concerns: “how to calculate business value?”\n\n\n\nimage-20250110082320573\n\n\nPicture by Manjeet Singh, Salesforce\nAs in in software development best practice, the agent development follows similar steps, which are:\n➡️ Ideate ➡️ Setup ➡️ Configure ➡️ Test ➡️ Deploy ➡️ Monitor 🔁\n\n\n\nimage-20250110083443875\n\n\nPicture by Manjeet Singh, Salesforce\n\n\nTesting and evaluation during agent application development is very important.\nAs in all generative AI usecase, the journey normally looks like this:\n➡️ Select a pre-trained LLM (e.g. gpt-4o or claude 3.5)\n➡️ Prompt Engineering (improve prompt with few shots)\n➡️ Prompt Engineering + RAG (longer prompts, slower inference)\n➡️ Advanced techniques (advanced RAG, finetuning - improve speed, quality and cost)\nHere is an example from Manjeet Singh, Salesforce to atomate agent evaluation.\n\n\n\nimage-20250110084935905\n\n\nPicture by Manjeet Singh, Salesforce\nBelow is an example of evaluation while considering a RAG (Retrieval Augmented Generation) pipeline.\n\n\n\nimage-20250110085416224\n\n\nPicture by Manjeet Singh, Salesforce"

Based on Christopher Potts: - Many weighting schemes end up favoring rare events that may not be trustworthy. - PMI and its variant will amplify the values of counts that are tiny relative to their row and columns. - TF-IDF severly punishes words that appear in many documents - it behaves oddly for dense matrices, which can include word x word matrices.\n\n# General use imports\nimport numpy as np\nimport pandas as pd\nimport seaborn as sns\nimport matplotlib.pyplot as plt\nimport math\nimport sys\n\n\nfrom sklearn.feature_extraction.text import TfidfVectorizer\nfrom sklearn.decomposition import NMF\nfrom sklearn.datasets import fetch_20newsgroups\n\n\n# Helper function from Christopher Potts used on the course CS224u, Stanford, Spring 2021 are used in the notebook.\n# Source github link is here: https://github.com/cgpotts/cs224u\n# Instead of using the word-to-word matrixes from CS224u, we used the dataset from 20newsgroups from sklearn and \n# generate the co-occurance matrix for the 100 first rows of this dataset.\n\nimport os\nimport vsm\nimport utils\n\n\n# 20newsgroups dataset \n# Test using 20newsgroups dataset from https://scikit-learn.org/stable/datasets/real_world.html#the-20-newsgroups-text-dataset\n# Download data\ndata = fetch_20newsgroups(remove=('headers', 'footers', 'quotes'))\n\n# Get the actual text data from the sklearn Bunch\ndata = data.get(\"data\")\n\n\nprint(data[:1])\n\n['I was wondering if anyone out there could enlighten me on this car I saw\\nthe other day.

NMF requires the sample features to be non-negative, thus NMF can tend to lose more information when truncating.\nNMF in text minining consider the bag-of-words matrix representation where each row corresponds to a word, and each column to a document.\nNMF will produce two matrices W and H, thus we can write V = W x H. According to COLYER, the columns W can be interpreted as the terms to topic information (i.e. topic/bags of words). H represents the importance of the given topic to a a given document.\nWe can be write NMF as: term-document matrix (V) = terms/topics (W) + topics/docs (H)\nIn practise, the inputs is: - count vectorizer or TF-IDF vectorizer\nthe parameters to tune are: - Number of topics - text preprocessing (e.g. stop words, min/max doc frequency, parts of speech)\nthe output: - W matrix representing relation between terms and topics - H matrix representing how to use the topics to reconstruct original documents (i.e. documents to topics relation)\n\n\n\nNMF\n\n\nReferences:\n[1] NML by IBM in coursera\n[2] COLYER\n[3] CS224U-2019 - Natural Language Understanding - Stanford Univerity"

When you build this model, you define the hyperparameter search space in addition to the model architecture.\nYou can define a hypermodel through two approaches:\n\nBy using a model builder function\nBy subclassing the HyperModel class of the Keras Tuner API\n\nIn this lab, you will take the first approach: you will use a model builder function to define the image classification model. This function returns a compiled model and uses hyperparameters you define inline to hypertune the model.\nThe function below basically builds the same model you used earlier. The difference is there are two hyperparameters that are setup for tuning:\n\nthe number of hidden units of the first Dense layer\nthe learning rate of the Adam optimizer\n\nYou will see that this is done with a HyperParameters object which configures the hyperparameter you’d like to tune. For this exercise, you will:\n\nuse its Int() method to define the search space for the Dense units. This allows you to set a minimum and maximum value, as well as the step size when incrementing between these values.\nuse its Choice() method for the learning rate. This allows you to define discrete values to include in the search space when hypertuning.\n\nYou can view all available methods and its sample usage in the official documentation.\n\ndef model_builder(hp):\n  '''\n  Builds the model and sets up the hyperparameters to tune.\n\n  Args:\n    hp - Keras tuner object\n\n  Returns:\n    model with hyperparameters to tune\n  '''\n\n  # Initialize the Sequential API and start stacking the layers\n  model = keras.Sequential()\n  #model.add(keras.layers.Flatten(input_shape=(28, 28)))\n\n  # Tune the number of units in the first Dense layer\n  # Choose an optimal value between 32-512\n  hp_units = hp.Int('units', min_value=32, max_value=512, step=32)\n  model.add(keras.layers.Dense(units=hp_units, activation='relu', name='dense_1'))\n\n  # Add next layers\n  model.add(keras.layers.Dropout(0.2))\n  model.add(tf.keras.layers.Dense(10,activation='relu',name='dense_2'))\n  model.add(keras.layers.Dropout(0.2))\n  model.add(tf.keras.layers.Dense(1,activation='relu',name='dense_3'))\n\n  # Tune the learning rate for the optimizer\n  # Choose an optimal value from 0.01, 0.001, or 0.0001\n  hp_learning_rate = hp.Choice('learning_rate', values=[1e-2, 1e-3, 1e-4])\n\n  model.compile(optimizer=keras.optimizers.Adam(learning_rate=hp_learning_rate),\n                loss=\"mean_absolute_error\",\n                metrics=['mean_absolute_error'])\n\n  return model"

    "text": "Instantiate the Tuner and perform hypertuning\nNow that you have the model builder, you can then define how the tuner can find the optimal set of hyperparameters, also called the search strategy. Keras Tuner has four tuners available with built-in strategies - RandomSearch, Hyperband, BayesianOptimization, and Sklearn.\nIn this tutorial, you will use the Hyperband tuner. Hyperband is an algorithm specifically developed for hyperparameter optimization. It uses adaptive resource allocation and early-stopping to quickly converge on a high-performing model. This is done using a sports championship style bracket wherein the algorithm trains a large number of models for a few epochs and carries forward only the top-performing half of models to the next round. You can read about the intuition behind the algorithm in section 3 of this paper.\nHyperband determines the number of models to train in a bracket by computing 1 + logfactor(max_epochs) and rounding it up to the nearest integer. You will see these parameters (i.e. factor and max_epochs passed into the initializer below). In addition, you will also need to define the following to instantiate the Hyperband tuner:\n\nthe hypermodel (built by your model builder function)\nthe objective to optimize (e.g. validation accuracy)\na directory to save logs and checkpoints for every trial (model configuration) run during the hyperparameter search. If you re-run the hyperparameter search, the Keras Tuner uses the existing state from these logs to resume the search. To disable this behavior, pass an additional overwrite=True argument while instantiating the tuner.\nthe project_name to differentiate with other runs. This will be used as a subdirectory name under the directory.\n\nYou can refer to the documentation for other arguments you can pass in.\n\n# Instantiate the tuner\ntuner = kt.Hyperband(model_builder,\n                     objective='val_mean_absolute_error',\n                     max_epochs=5,\n                     factor=3,\n                     directory='kt_dir',\n                     project_name='kt_hyperband')\n\nLet’s see a summary of the hyperparameters that you will tune:\n\n# Display hypertuning settings\ntuner.search_space_summary()\n\nYou can pass in a callback to stop training early when a metric is not improving. Below, we define an EarlyStopping callback to monitor the validation loss and stop training if it’s not improving after 5 epochs.\n\nstop_early = tf.keras.callbacks.EarlyStopping(monitor='val_mean_absolute_error', patience=5)\n\nYou will now run the hyperparameter search. The arguments for the search method are the same as those used for tf.keras.model.fit in addition to the callback above. This will take around 10 minutes to run.\n\n# Perform hypertuning\ntuner.search(X_train, Y_train, epochs=NUM_EPOCHS, validation_split=0.2, callbacks=[stop_early])\n\nYou can get the top performing model with the get_best_hyperparameters() method.\n\n# Get the optimal hyperparameters from the results\nbest_hps=tuner.get_best_hyperparameters()[0]\n\nprint(f\"\"\"\nThe hyperparameter search is complete. The optimal number of units in the first densely-connected\nlayer is {best_hps.get('units')} and the optimal learning rate for the optimizer\nis {best_hps.get('learning_rate')}.\n\"\"\")"

The bucket used must be in the same region as where training will run. In the cells above you downloaded the GLUE/SST2 training and validation split datasets and uploaded the json files in an S3 bucket in your account. This example will train on those json files.\nAfter you successfully run this example tensor parallel training job, you can modify the S3 bucket to where your own dataset is stored.\n\n%store -r training_dataset_location\n%store -r validation_dataset_location\n\n# if you're bringing your own data, uncomment the following lines and specify the locations there\n# training_dataset_location = YOUR_S3_BUCKET/training\n# validation_dataset_location = YOUR_S3_BUCKET/validation\n\n\ns3_train_bucket = training_dataset_location\ns3_test_bucket = validation_dataset_location\n\nThe following S3 bucket will store the output artifacts of the training job.

If you are using models above 13B, checkpointing should be done using FSx.\nPlease see the instructions from Distributed Training of Mask-RCNN in Amazon SageMaker Using FSx to create an FSx Lustre file system and import the dataset from the S3 bucket to your FSx file system. Note that the FSx file system must be created in a private subnet with internet gateway to ensure that training job has access to the internet. For general guidance on setting an FSx Lustre file system as data input channel, see Configure Data Input Channel to Use Amazon FSx for Lustre.\n\n# Instructions obtained from:\n# https://github.com/aws/amazon-sagemaker-examples/blob/master/advanced_functionality/distributed_tensorflow_mask_rcnn/mask-rcnn-scriptmode-fsx.ipynb\n\nif use_fsx:\n    from sagemaker.inputs import FileSystemInput\n\n    # Specify FSx Lustre file system id.\n    file_system_id = \"&lt;your-file-system-id&gt;\"\n\n    # Specify the SG and subnet used by the FSX, these are passed to SM Estimator so jobs use this as well\n    fsx_security_group_id = \"&lt;your-security-group-id&gt;\"\n    fsx_subnet = \"&lt;your-subnet&gt;\"\n\n    # Specify directory path for input data on the file system.\n    # You need to provide normalized and absolute path below.\n    # Your mount name can be provided by you when creating fsx, or generated automatically.\n    # You can find this mount_name on the FSX page in console.\n    # Example of fsx generated mount_name: \"3x5lhbmv\"\n    base_path = \"&lt;your-mount-name&gt;\"\n\n    # Specify your file system type.\n    file_system_type = \"FSxLustre\"\n\n    train = FileSystemInput(\n        file_system_id=file_system_id,\n        file_system_type=file_system_type,\n        directory_path=base_path,\n        file_system_access_mode=\"rw\",\n    )\n\n    data_channels = {\"train\": train, \"test\": train}\n\n\n\n\nThe following hyperparameters dictionary passes arguments to the training script (train.py) and set the model parallel configuration when creating the training job.\nYou can also add custom mpi flags. By default, we have --mca btl_vader_single_copy_mechanism none to remove unnecessary logs.\nNext, we add a base metric definitions to enable the metric upload in SageMaker. You can add any further metric definitions.\nNote that we add the sharded_data_parallel_degree parameter to the hyperparameter dictionary.

You can use the SMP API to create a single, unified model after training: the smp.DistributedModel.save_model() method for TensorFlow, and the smp.save() function for PyTorch.\nAfter you build and train your models, you can deploy them to get predictions in one of two ways:\n\nTo set up a persistent endpoint to get predictions from your models, use SageMaker hosting services. For an overview on deploying a single model or multiple models with SageMaker hosting services, see Deploy a Model on SageMaker Hosting Services.\nTo get predictions for an entire dataset, use SageMaker batch transform. For an overview on deploying a model with SageMaker Batch Transform, see Get Inferences for an Entire Dataset with Batch Transform.\n\nTo learn more about deploying models for inference using SageMaker, see Deploy Models for Inference.\n\n\n\nThis notebook was tested in multiple regions.

In ML, feature extraction techniques allows us to reduce the number of features in a dataset. Different from feature selection whchig maintain the original features, feature extraction transform or project the data onto new feature spaces.\nFeature extraction improves the predictive performance of a given model by reducing the curse of dimensionality. PCA finds correlation between the features by finding the directions of maximum variance in high-dimentional data and it projects the data onto a new subspace with equal or fewer dimensions. The ortogonal axes (principal components) of the new subspace should be interpreted as the directions of maximum variance given the constraint constraint that the new feature axes are ortogonal to each other [1].\nImage(filename=‘images/GaussianScatterPCA.png’)\nNote that PCA directions are high sensitive to data scaling, thus the need to standardize the features prior to PCA.\nAs described in [1], The main steps behing PCA are:\n\nStandardize the d-dimentional dataset\nConstruct the covariance matrix\nDecompose the covariance matrix into its eigenvectors and eigenvalues\nSort the eigenvalues by decreasing order to rank the corresponding eigenvectors\nSelect k eigeinvectors, which correspond to the k largest eigenvalues, where k is the dimensionality of the new feature space ($(k &lt;= d))\nConstruct a projection matrix, W, from the top k eigenvectors.\nTransform the d-dimensional input dataset, X, using the projection matrix W, to obtain the new k-dimensional feature space.\n\n[1] Python Machine Learning - by Sebastian Raschka [2] Python Machine Learning - Code Example Chapter 5 -

    "text": "Wikipedia Definition: Prompt engineering is a concept in artificial intelligence (AI), particularly natural language processing (NLP). In prompt engineering, the description of the task that the AI is supposed to accomplish is embedded in the input, e.g., as a question, instead of it being implicitly given. Prompt engineering typically works by converting one or more tasks to a prompt-based dataset and training a language model with what has been called “prompt-based learning” or just “prompt learning”.\nIn this notebook I will use the OpenAI APIs and SerAPI together with LangChain, a framework for developing applications powered by language models that allow us to connect a language model to other sources of data.\nFigure below by DAIR.AI | Elvis Saravia, describe the elements of a prompt.\n\n\n\nElements of Prompt\n\n\nThis notebook is inspired by “Getting Started with Prompt Engineering” from DAIR.AI | Elvis Saravia.

    "text": "[TOC]\n\n\nNowadays, there are several fronts on improving Large Language Models at both inference and training. Techniques such as quantization, distillation and optimizations at the attention mechanism are continuously been improved to either reduce model size or memory footprint.\nFor example, in quantization the use of Int8 type at inference can reduce memory footprint of large models by a factor of 2x.\nThe sequential generation process of autoregressive transformer which generates words (tokens) one at a time based on the input prompt and previous sequence, makes the GPU workload memory-bound, underutilizing the computation power of GPUs and limiting the serving throughput.\nIn order to make sure workloads are predominantly compute-bound at GPUs (and not memory-bound) several solutions have been proposed to optimize the attention mechanism commonly used by autoregressive transformer, which includes FlashAttention, PagedAttention and Multi-Head Latent Attention discussed below.\nBut before diving into those mechanism, let have a quick overview of attention mechanism. In this article we are focusing on autoregressive attention mechanism (i.e. attention for decoder-only models).\n\n\n\nA Brief history…\nPrior to Transformers, RNN (Recurrent Neural Network) was the state of the art on NLP (Natural Language Processing) tasks such as translation. But a short-coming of RNNs is that it losses context in complex sentences where dependencies span long distance. This due to the fact that the encoder-decoder RNNs was unable to direct access earlier hidden states during decoding phase and therefore RNN was forced to remember the entire encoded input in a single hidden state before passing it to the decoder. [S Raschka].\nBahdanau attention mechanism for RNN was proposed in 2014 as a way for RNN to selective access different parts of the input sequence at each decoding step. The Transformer architecture included the self-attention mechanism inspired by Bahdanau attention mechanism. The basic idea of the attention mechanism is to identify high correlation patterns among words in a given sentence, assuming it has learned word correlation patterns from the training data.\nHow Self-Attention works …\nThe diagram below from Wikipedia shows the attention forward pass calculation correlations of the word “that” with the other words in the sentence ” See that girl run.” Basically, given the right weights from training, the network can identify “girl” as the next token (i.e. highest correlated word in the sentence).\n\n\n\nAttention-qkv\n\n\nPicture by Wikipedia.\nFrom Self-Attention to Multi-Head Attention …\nMulti-head attention contains multiple self-attention blocks in order to encapsulate multiple complex relationship between different items in a sequence. In practice, the implementation of multi-head attention represents multiple instances of the self-attention, each with its own weights (i.e. different learned linear projections).\nOther efficient adaptation of the multi-head attention is for example the Grouped-Query Attention and Multi-Query Attention. Grouped-query attention is used by models like Llama 3.\n\n\n\nimage-20250103143203890\n\n\nPicture by Multi-Query Attention\nReference:\n\nAttention (machine learning) by Wikipedia\nA Study of Attention Mechanism by Nilesh Barla\nBuild A Large Language Model by Sebastian Raschka\nHands-On Large Language Models - Language Understanding and Generation by J. Alammar\nFast Transformer Decoding: One Write-Head is All You Need by N. Shazeer\nGQA: Training Generalized Multi-Query Transformer Models from Multi-Head Checkpoints by J. Ainslie et. al.\n\n\n\n\nThe attention layer is the main bottleneck in scaling longer sequences, as its runtime and memory increase quadratically in the sequence length [ref. FlashAttention-2].\nTo reduce computational requirement of attention on such long context, techniques such as FlashAttention has been proposed to reorder the attention computation and leverages classical techniques such as tilling and recomputation, to speed up and reduce memory usage from quadratic to linear in sequence length (2-4x faster than a standard attention implementation).\nTo check the list of flash attention adopters, check https://github.com/Dao-AILab/flash-attention/blob/main/usage.md\nBefore diving into Flash Attention we need to introduce the GPU hardware characteristics\n\n\nMain components of a modern GPU are:\n\nOn-chip SRAM (a.k.a. as shared memory e.g. A100 19TB/s - 192KB per 108 streaming)\nHBM (High Bandwidth Memory) (e.g. A100 - 40-80GB and 1.5-2.0TB/s )\nSM (streaming multiprocessor) (e.g. A100 - 108 stream multiprocessors )\n\n1 SM - 1 Thread block -&gt; Warp (1 warp - 32 threads)\n\n\n\nPicture By Deep Learning Hero. How does matrix multiplication work inside GPUs - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wIPdrbZIeKE\nIn GPUs, operations are executed in threads (a.k.a. kernel). Threads are organized into thread blocks, which are scheduled to run on streaming multiprocessors (SMs)\nWithin each thread blocks, threads are grouped into warps ( 1 warp equal 3 threads). Threads within a warp can communicate by fast shuffe instructions or cooperate to perform matrix multiply.\nWarps within a thread block can communicate by reading from and writing to shared memory. Each kernel loads inputs from HBM to registers and SRAM, computes, then writes outputs to HBM.\n\n\n\nimage-20240506135327900\n\n\nPicture By Deep Learning Hero. How does matrix multiplication work inside GPUs - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wIPdrbZIeKE\n\nPicture by Dissecting the Ampere GPU Architecture through Microbenchmarking - https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/on-demand/session/gtcspring21-s33322/\nTable below shows the comparison between certain GPU types across its main characteristics.\n\n\n\nGPU Type\nArchitecture\nSM\nHBM\nSRAM\nNotes\n\n\n\n\nA100\nNVIDIA Ampere\n108\n40 GB (1.5TB/s)\n\n\n\n\nH100\nNVIDIA Hopper\n144\n80GB (2.0TB/s)\n\nTensor Memory Accelerator, DPX (Dynamic Programming) Instructions, FP8 Tensor Cores, DSMEM (Distributed Shared Memory)\n\n\nH200\nNVIDIA Hopper\n\n141GB (4.8TB/s)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLots of data loading turns computation in memory bound and not compute bound.\nFor each attention head, to reduce memory reads/writes, FlashAttention uses classical tiling techniques to load blocks of query, key, and value from GPU HBM (its main memory) to SRAM (its fast cache), compute attention with respect to that block, and write back the output to HBM. This reduction in memory reads/writes brings significant speedup (2-4x) in most cases. [ref. https://www.adept.ai/blog/flashier-attention]\nThe figure below is from FlashAttention paper showing on the left that FlashAttention uses tiling to prevent materialization of the large 𝑁 × 𝑁 attention matrix (dotted box) on (relatively) slow GPU HBM.\nHere in the outer loop (red arrows), FlashAttention loops through blocks of the K and V matrices and loads them to fast on-chip SRAM. In each block, FlashAttention loops over blocks of Q matrix (blue arrows), loading them to SRAM, and writing the output of the attention computation back to HBM.\nOn the right you see the speedup over the PyTorch implementation of attention on GPT-2. FlashAttention does not read and write the large 𝑁 × 𝑁 attention matrix to HBM, resulting in an 7.6× speedup on the attention computation according to the paper.\n\n\n\nimage-20240507155528488\n\n\n\n\n\nPyTorch implements flash attention at https://pytorch.org/docs/stable/generated/torch.nn.functional.scaled_dot_product_attention.html.\nBelow is a code snipped example from DeepLearning Hero using pytorch.\nwith torch.backends.cuda.sdp_kernel(\n        enable_flash=False, enable_math=True, enable_mem_efficient=True\n):\nCheck FlashAttention - Fast and Memory Efficient Attention Mechanism in https://marcelcastrobr.github.io/ for a notebook implementation.\nReferences:\n\nFlashAttention: Fast and Memory-Efficient Exact Attention with IO-Awareness - https://arxiv.org/abs/2205.14135\nFlashAttention-2: Faster Attention with Better Parallelism and Work Partitioning https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.08691\nMatrix Multiplication: Inner Product, Outer Product & Systolic Array https://www.adityaagrawal.net/blog/architecture/matrix_multiplication\nBenchmarking and Dissecting the Nvidia Hopper GPU Architecture https://arxiv.org/pdf/2402.13499v1\nNVIDIA Hopper Architecture In-Depth https://developer.nvidia.com/blog/nvidia-hopper-architecture-in-depth/\nFlashAttention: Fast Transformer training with long sequences https://www.adept.ai/blog/flashier-attention\nAWS Broadcast https://broadcast.amazon.com/videos/670513?ref=personal\nAndrej Karpathy implementation - https://twitter.com/karpathy/status/1786461447654125625?s=51\nFlashAttention - Fast and Memory Efficient Attention Mechanism by Marcel Castro - https://marcelcastrobr.github.io/posts/2024-04-07-flashattention.html\n\n\n\n\n\nKey-value cache (KV cache) memory for each request in the attention mechanism is huge and grows and shrinks dynamically. When managed inefficiently, this memory can be significantly wasted by fragmentation and redundant duplication, limiting the batch size.\nPageAttention propose to improve the LLM throughput by batching multiple requests together. Thus to process many requests in a batch needs an efficient memory management.\nAs discussed in [Efficient Memory Management for Large Language Model Serving with PagedAttention] , approximately 65% of memory is allocated to mode weights which are static parameters during serving (considering a 13Billion parameter model on NVIDIA A100 GPU with 40GB RAM). Close to 30% of the memory is used to store the dynamic states of the requests (a.k.a KV cache). The remaining memory is used for other data such as activations.\nSince model weights are constant and the activations only occupy a small fraction of the GPU memory, the way KV cache if managed is critical in determining the maximum batch size.\n\nPicture from Paper Efficient Memory Management for Large Language Model Serving with PagedAttention. In the Left: Memory layout when serving an LLM with 13B parameters on NVIDIA A100. The parameters (gray) persist in GPU memory throughout serving. The memory for the KV cache (red) is (de)allocated per serving request. A small amount of memory (yellow) is used ephemerally for activation.

    "text": "Nowadays, there are several fronts on improving Large Language Models at both inference and training. Techniques such as quantization, distillation and optimizations at the attention mechanism are continuously been improved to either reduce model size or memory footprint.\nFor example, in quantization the use of Int8 type at inference can reduce memory footprint of large models by a factor of 2x.\nThe sequential generation process of autoregressive transformer which generates words (tokens) one at a time based on the input prompt and previous sequence, makes the GPU workload memory-bound, underutilizing the computation power of GPUs and limiting the serving throughput.\nIn order to make sure workloads are predominantly compute-bound at GPUs (and not memory-bound) several solutions have been proposed to optimize the attention mechanism commonly used by autoregressive transformer, which includes FlashAttention, PagedAttention and Multi-Head Latent Attention discussed below.\nBut before diving into those mechanism, let have a quick overview of attention mechanism. In this article we are focusing on autoregressive attention mechanism (i.e. attention for decoder-only models)."

    "text": "A Brief history…\nPrior to Transformers, RNN (Recurrent Neural Network) was the state of the art on NLP (Natural Language Processing) tasks such as translation. But a short-coming of RNNs is that it losses context in complex sentences where dependencies span long distance. This due to the fact that the encoder-decoder RNNs was unable to direct access earlier hidden states during decoding phase and therefore RNN was forced to remember the entire encoded input in a single hidden state before passing it to the decoder. [S Raschka].\nBahdanau attention mechanism for RNN was proposed in 2014 as a way for RNN to selective access different parts of the input sequence at each decoding step. The Transformer architecture included the self-attention mechanism inspired by Bahdanau attention mechanism. The basic idea of the attention mechanism is to identify high correlation patterns among words in a given sentence, assuming it has learned word correlation patterns from the training data.\nHow Self-Attention works …\nThe diagram below from Wikipedia shows the attention forward pass calculation correlations of the word “that” with the other words in the sentence ” See that girl run.” Basically, given the right weights from training, the network can identify “girl” as the next token (i.e. highest correlated word in the sentence).\n\n\n\nAttention-qkv\n\n\nPicture by Wikipedia.\nFrom Self-Attention to Multi-Head Attention …\nMulti-head attention contains multiple self-attention blocks in order to encapsulate multiple complex relationship between different items in a sequence. In practice, the implementation of multi-head attention represents multiple instances of the self-attention, each with its own weights (i.e. different learned linear projections).\nOther efficient adaptation of the multi-head attention is for example the Grouped-Query Attention and Multi-Query Attention. Grouped-query attention is used by models like Llama 3.\n\n\n\nimage-20250103143203890\n\n\nPicture by Multi-Query Attention\nReference:\n\nAttention (machine learning) by Wikipedia\nA Study of Attention Mechanism by Nilesh Barla\nBuild A Large Language Model by Sebastian Raschka\nHands-On Large Language Models - Language Understanding and Generation by J.

    "text": "The attention layer is the main bottleneck in scaling longer sequences, as its runtime and memory increase quadratically in the sequence length [ref. FlashAttention-2].\nTo reduce computational requirement of attention on such long context, techniques such as FlashAttention has been proposed to reorder the attention computation and leverages classical techniques such as tilling and recomputation, to speed up and reduce memory usage from quadratic to linear in sequence length (2-4x faster than a standard attention implementation).\nTo check the list of flash attention adopters, check https://github.com/Dao-AILab/flash-attention/blob/main/usage.md\nBefore diving into Flash Attention we need to introduce the GPU hardware characteristics\n\n\nMain components of a modern GPU are:\n\nOn-chip SRAM (a.k.a. as shared memory e.g. A100 19TB/s - 192KB per 108 streaming)\nHBM (High Bandwidth Memory) (e.g. A100 - 40-80GB and 1.5-2.0TB/s )\nSM (streaming multiprocessor) (e.g. A100 - 108 stream multiprocessors )\n\n1 SM - 1 Thread block -&gt; Warp (1 warp - 32 threads)\n\n\n\nPicture By Deep Learning Hero. How does matrix multiplication work inside GPUs - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wIPdrbZIeKE\nIn GPUs, operations are executed in threads (a.k.a. kernel). Threads are organized into thread blocks, which are scheduled to run on streaming multiprocessors (SMs)\nWithin each thread blocks, threads are grouped into warps ( 1 warp equal 3 threads). Threads within a warp can communicate by fast shuffe instructions or cooperate to perform matrix multiply.\nWarps within a thread block can communicate by reading from and writing to shared memory. Each kernel loads inputs from HBM to registers and SRAM, computes, then writes outputs to HBM.\n\n\n\nimage-20240506135327900\n\n\nPicture By Deep Learning Hero. How does matrix multiplication work inside GPUs - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wIPdrbZIeKE\n\nPicture by Dissecting the Ampere GPU Architecture through Microbenchmarking - https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/on-demand/session/gtcspring21-s33322/\nTable below shows the comparison between certain GPU types across its main characteristics.\n\n\n\nGPU Type\nArchitecture\nSM\nHBM\nSRAM\nNotes\n\n\n\n\nA100\nNVIDIA Ampere\n108\n40 GB (1.5TB/s)\n\n\n\n\nH100\nNVIDIA Hopper\n144\n80GB (2.0TB/s)\n\nTensor Memory Accelerator, DPX (Dynamic Programming) Instructions, FP8 Tensor Cores, DSMEM (Distributed Shared Memory)\n\n\nH200\nNVIDIA Hopper\n\n141GB (4.8TB/s)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLots of data loading turns computation in memory bound and not compute bound.\nFor each attention head, to reduce memory reads/writes, FlashAttention uses classical tiling techniques to load blocks of query, key, and value from GPU HBM (its main memory) to SRAM (its fast cache), compute attention with respect to that block, and write back the output to HBM. This reduction in memory reads/writes brings significant speedup (2-4x) in most cases. [ref. https://www.adept.ai/blog/flashier-attention]\nThe figure below is from FlashAttention paper showing on the left that FlashAttention uses tiling to prevent materialization of the large 𝑁 × 𝑁 attention matrix (dotted box) on (relatively) slow GPU HBM.\nHere in the outer loop (red arrows), FlashAttention loops through blocks of the K and V matrices and loads them to fast on-chip SRAM. In each block, FlashAttention loops over blocks of Q matrix (blue arrows), loading them to SRAM, and writing the output of the attention computation back to HBM.\nOn the right you see the speedup over the PyTorch implementation of attention on GPT-2. FlashAttention does not read and write the large 𝑁 × 𝑁 attention matrix to HBM, resulting in an 7.6× speedup on the attention computation according to the paper.\n\n\n\nimage-20240507155528488\n\n\n\n\n\nPyTorch implements flash attention at https://pytorch.org/docs/stable/generated/torch.nn.functional.scaled_dot_product_attention.html.\nBelow is a code snipped example from DeepLearning Hero using pytorch.\nwith torch.backends.cuda.sdp_kernel(\n        enable_flash=False, enable_math=True, enable_mem_efficient=True\n):\nCheck FlashAttention - Fast and Memory Efficient Attention Mechanism in https://marcelcastrobr.github.io/ for a notebook implementation.\nReferences:\n\nFlashAttention: Fast and Memory-Efficient Exact Attention with IO-Awareness - https://arxiv.org/abs/2205.14135\nFlashAttention-2: Faster Attention with Better Parallelism and Work Partitioning https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.08691\nMatrix Multiplication: Inner Product, Outer Product & Systolic Array https://www.adityaagrawal.net/blog/architecture/matrix_multiplication\nBenchmarking and Dissecting the Nvidia Hopper GPU Architecture https://arxiv.org/pdf/2402.13499v1\nNVIDIA Hopper Architecture In-Depth https://developer.nvidia.com/blog/nvidia-hopper-architecture-in-depth/\nFlashAttention: Fast Transformer training with long sequences https://www.adept.ai/blog/flashier-attention\nAWS Broadcast https://broadcast.amazon.com/videos/670513?ref=personal\nAndrej Karpathy implementation - https://twitter.com/karpathy/status/1786461447654125625?s=51\nFlashAttention - Fast and Memory Efficient Attention Mechanism by Marcel Castro - https://marcelcastrobr.github.io/posts/2024-04-07-flashattention.html"

When managed inefficiently, this memory can be significantly wasted by fragmentation and redundant duplication, limiting the batch size.\nPageAttention propose to improve the LLM throughput by batching multiple requests together. Thus to process many requests in a batch needs an efficient memory management.\nAs discussed in [Efficient Memory Management for Large Language Model Serving with PagedAttention] , approximately 65% of memory is allocated to mode weights which are static parameters during serving (considering a 13Billion parameter model on NVIDIA A100 GPU with 40GB RAM). Close to 30% of the memory is used to store the dynamic states of the requests (a.k.a KV cache). The remaining memory is used for other data such as activations.\nSince model weights are constant and the activations only occupy a small fraction of the GPU memory, the way KV cache if managed is critical in determining the maximum batch size.\n\nPicture from Paper Efficient Memory Management for Large Language Model Serving with PagedAttention.

    "text": "Week 1 Assignment: Data Validation\nTensorflow Data Validation (TFDV) is an open-source library that helps to understand, validate, and monitor production machine learning (ML) data at scale. Common use-cases include comparing training, evaluation and serving datasets, as well as checking for training/serving skew. You have seen the core functionalities of this package in the previous ungraded lab and you will get to practice them in this week’s assignment.\nIn this lab, you will use TFDV in order to:\n\nGenerate and visualize statistics from a dataframe\nInfer a dataset schema\nCalculate, visualize and fix anomalies\n\nLet’s begin!\n ## 1 - Setup and Imports\n\n# Import packages\nimport os\nimport pandas as pd\nimport tensorflow as tf\nimport tempfile, urllib, zipfile\nimport tensorflow_data_validation as tfdv\n\n\nfrom tensorflow.python.lib.io import file_io\nfrom tensorflow_data_validation.utils import slicing_util\nfrom tensorflow_metadata.proto.v0.statistics_pb2 import DatasetFeatureStatisticsList, DatasetFeatureStatistics\n\n# Set TF's logger to only display errors to avoid internal warnings being shown\ntf.get_logger().setLevel('ERROR')\n\n ## 2 - Load the Dataset You will be using the Diabetes 130-US hospitals for years 1999-2008 Data Set donated to the University of California, Irvine (UCI) Machine Learning Repository. The dataset represents 10 years (1999-2008) of clinical care at 130 US hospitals and integrated delivery networks. It includes over 50 features representing patient and hospital outcomes.\nThis dataset has already been included in your Jupyter workspace so you can easily load it.\n ### 2.1 Read and Split the Dataset\n\n# Read CSV data into a dataframe and recognize the missing data that is encoded with '?' string as NaN\ndf = pd.read_csv('dataset_diabetes/diabetic_data.csv', header=0, na_values = '?')\n\n# Preview the dataset\ndf.head()\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nencounter_id\npatient_nbr\nrace\ngender\nage\nweight\nadmission_type_id\ndischarge_disposition_id\nadmission_source_id\ntime_in_hospital\n...\ncitoglipton\ninsulin\nglyburide-metformin\nglipizide-metformin\nglimepiride-pioglitazone\nmetformin-rosiglitazone\nmetformin-pioglitazone\nchange\ndiabetesMed\nreadmitted\n\n\n\n\n0\n2278392\n8222157\nCaucasian\nFemale\n[0-10)\nNaN\n6\n25\n1\n1\n...\nNo\nNo\nNo\nNo\nNo\nNo\nNo\nNo\nNo\nNO\n\n\n1\n149190\n55629189\nCaucasian\nFemale\n[10-20)\nNaN\n1\n1\n7\n3\n...\nNo\nUp\nNo\nNo\nNo\nNo\nNo\nCh\nYes\n&gt;30\n\n\n2\n64410\n86047875\nAfricanAmerican\nFemale\n[20-30)\nNaN\n1\n1\n7\n2\n...\nNo\nNo\nNo\nNo\nNo\nNo\nNo\nNo\nYes\nNO\n\n\n3\n500364\n82442376\nCaucasian\nMale\n[30-40)\nNaN\n1\n1\n7\n2\n...\nNo\nUp\nNo\nNo\nNo\nNo\nNo\nCh\nYes\nNO\n\n\n4\n16680\n42519267\nCaucasian\nMale\n[40-50)\nNaN\n1\n1\n7\n1\n...\nNo\nSteady\nNo\nNo\nNo\nNo\nNo\nCh\nYes\nNO\n\n\n\n\n5 rows × 50 columns\n\n\n\n #### Data splits\nIn a production ML system, the model performance can be negatively affected by anomalies and divergence between data splits for training, evaluation, and serving. To emulate a production system, you will split the dataset into:\n\n70% training set\n15% evaluation set\n15% serving set\n\nYou will then use TFDV to visualize, analyze, and understand the data. You will create a data schema from the training dataset, then compare the evaluation and serving sets with this schema to detect anomalies and data drift/skew.\n #### Label Column\nThis dataset has been prepared to analyze the factors related to readmission outcome. In this notebook, you will treat the readmitted column as the target or label column.\nThe target (or label) is important to know while splitting the data into training, evaluation and serving sets. In supervised learning, you need to include the target in the training and evaluation datasets. For the serving set however (i.e. the set that simulates the data coming from your users), the label column needs to be dropped since that is the feature that your model will be trying to predict.\nThe following function returns the training, evaluation and serving partitions of a given dataset:\n\ndef prepare_data_splits_from_dataframe(df):\n    '''\n    Splits a Pandas Dataframe into training, evaluation and serving sets.\n\n    Parameters:\n            df : pandas dataframe to split\n\n    Returns:\n            train_df: Training dataframe(70% of the entire dataset)\n            eval_df: Evaluation dataframe (15% of the entire dataset) \n            serving_df: Serving dataframe (15% of the entire dataset, label column dropped)\n    '''\n    \n    # 70% of records for generating the training set\n    train_len = int(len(df) * 0.7)\n    \n    # Remaining 30% of records for generating the evaluation and serving sets\n    eval_serv_len = len(df) - train_len\n    \n    # Half of the 30%, which makes up 15% of total records, for generating the evaluation set\n    eval_len = eval_serv_len // 2\n    \n    # Remaining 15% of total records for generating the serving set\n    serv_len = eval_serv_len - eval_len \n \n    # Sample the train, validation and serving sets. We specify a random state for repeatable outcomes.\n    train_df = df.iloc[:train_len].sample(frac=1, random_state=48).reset_index(drop=True)\n    eval_df = df.iloc[train_len: train_len + eval_len].sample(frac=1, random_state=48).reset_index(drop=True)\n    serving_df = df.iloc[train_len + eval_len: train_len + eval_len + serv_len].sample(frac=1, random_state=48).reset_index(drop=True)\n \n    # Serving data emulates the data that would be submitted for predictions, so it should not have the label column.\n    serving_df = serving_df.drop(['readmitted'], axis=1)\n\n    return train_df, eval_df, serving_df\n\n\n# Split the datasets\ntrain_df, eval_df, serving_df = prepare_data_splits_from_dataframe(df)\nprint('Training dataset has {} records\\nValidation dataset has {} records\\nServing dataset has {} records'.format(len(train_df),len(eval_df),len(serving_df)))\n\nTraining dataset has 71236 records\nValidation dataset has 15265 records\nServing dataset has 15265 records\n\n\n ## 3 - Generate and Visualize Training Data Statistics\nIn this section, you will be generating descriptive statistics from the dataset. This is usually the first step when dealing with a dataset you are not yet familiar with. It is also known as performing an exploratory data analysis and its purpose is to understand the data types, the data itself and any possible issues that need to be addressed.\nIt is important to mention that exploratory data analysis should be perfomed on the training dataset only. This is because getting information out of the evaluation or serving datasets can be seen as “cheating” since this data is used to emulate data that you have not collected yet and will try to predict using your ML algorithm. In general, it is a good practice to avoid leaking information from your evaluation and serving data into your model.\n ### Removing Irrelevant Features\nBefore you generate the statistics, you may want to drop irrelevant features from your dataset. You can do that with TFDV with the tfdv.StatsOptions class. It is usually not a good idea to drop features without knowing what information they contain. However there are times when this can be fairly obvious.\nOne of the important parameters of the StatsOptions class is feature_whitelist, which defines the features to include while calculating the data statistics. You can check the documentation to learn more about the class arguments.\nIn this case, you will omit the statistics for encounter_id and patient_nbr since they are part of the internal tracking of patients in the hospital and they don’t contain valuable information for the task at hand.\n\n# Define features to remove\nfeatures_to_remove = {'encounter_id', 'patient_nbr'}\n\n# Collect features to whitelist while computing the statistics\napproved_cols = [col for col in df.columns if (col not in features_to_remove)]\n\n# Instantiate a StatsOptions class and define the feature_whitelist property\nstats_options = tfdv.StatsOptions(feature_whitelist=approved_cols)\n\n# Review the features to generate the statistics\nprint(stats_options.feature_whitelist)\n\n['race', 'gender', 'age', 'weight', 'admission_type_id', 'discharge_disposition_id', 'admission_source_id', 'time_in_hospital', 'payer_code', 'medical_specialty', 'num_lab_procedures', 'num_procedures', 'num_medications', 'number_outpatient', 'number_emergency', 'number_inpatient', 'diag_1', 'diag_2', 'diag_3', 'number_diagnoses', 'max_glu_serum', 'A1Cresult', 'metformin', 'repaglinide', 'nateglinide', 'chlorpropamide', 'glimepiride', 'acetohexamide', 'glipizide', 'glyburide', 'tolbutamide', 'pioglitazone', 'rosiglitazone', 'acarbose', 'miglitol', 'troglitazone', 'tolazamide', 'examide', 'citoglipton', 'insulin', 'glyburide-metformin', 'glipizide-metformin', 'glimepiride-pioglitazone', 'metformin-rosiglitazone', 'metformin-pioglitazone', 'change', 'diabetesMed', 'readmitted']\n\n\n ### Exercise 1: Generate Training Statistics\nTFDV allows you to generate statistics from different data formats such as CSV or a Pandas DataFrame.\nSince you already have the data stored in a DataFrame you can use the function tfdv.generate_statistics_from_dataframe() which, given a DataFrame and stats_options, generates an object of type DatasetFeatureStatisticsList. This object includes the computed statistics of the given dataset.\nComplete the cell below to generate the statistics of the training set. Remember to pass the training dataframe and the stats_options that you defined above as arguments.\n\n### START CODE HERE\ntrain_stats = tfdv.generate_statistics_from_dataframe(train_df, stats_options)\n### END CODE HERE\n\n\n# TEST CODE\n\n# get the number of features used to compute statistics\nprint(f\"Number of features used: {len(train_stats.datasets[0].features)}\")\n\n# check the number of examples used\nprint(f\"Number of examples used: {train_stats.datasets[0].num_examples}\")\n\n# check the column names of the first and last feature\nprint(f\"First feature: {train_stats.datasets[0].features[0].path.step[0]}\")\nprint(f\"Last feature: {train_stats.datasets[0].features[-1].path.step[0]}\")\n\nNumber of features used: 48\nNumber of examples used: 71236\nFirst feature: race\nLast feature: readmitted\n\n\nExpected Output:\nNumber of features used: 48\nNumber of examples used: 71236\nFirst feature: race\nLast feature: readmitted\n ### Exercise 2: Visualize Training Statistics\nNow that you have the computed statistics in the DatasetFeatureStatisticsList instance, you will need a way to visualize these to get actual insights. TFDV provides this functionality through the method tfdv.visualize_statistics().\nUsing this function in an interactive Python environment such as this one will output a very nice and convenient way to interact with the descriptive statistics you generated earlier.\nTry it out yourself! Remember to pass in the generated training statistics in the previous exercise as an argument.\n\n### START CODE HERE\ntfdv.visualize_statistics(train_stats)\n### END CODE HERE\n\n\n        \n\n\n ## 4 - Infer a data schema\nA schema defines the properties of the data and can thus be used to detect errors. Some of these properties include:\n\nwhich features are expected to be present\nfeature type\nthe number of values for a feature in each example\nthe presence of each feature across all examples\nthe expected domains of features\n\nThe schema is expected to be fairly static, whereas statistics can vary per data split. So, you will infer the data schema from only the training dataset. Later, you will generate statistics for evaluation and serving datasets and compare their state with the data schema to detect anomalies, drift and skew.\n ### Exercise 3: Infer the training set schema\nSchema inference is straightforward using tfdv.infer_schema(). This function needs only the statistics (an instance of DatasetFeatureStatisticsList) of your data as input. The output will be a Schema protocol buffer containing the results.\nA complimentary function is tfdv.display_schema() for displaying the schema in a table. This accepts a Schema protocol buffer as input.\nFill the code below to infer the schema from the training statistics using TFDV and display the result.\n\n### START CODE HERE\n# Infer the data schema

schema of the evaluation data is consistent with the training data since the data that your model is going to receive should be consistent to the one you used to train it with.\nMoreover, it is also important that the features of the evaluation data belong roughly to the same range as the training data. This ensures that the model will be evaluated on a similar loss surface covered during training.\n ### Exercise 4: Compare Training and Evaluation Statistics\nNow you are going to generate the evaluation statistics and compare it with training statistics. You can use the tfdv.generate_statistics_from_dataframe() function for this. But this time, you’ll need to pass the evaluation data. For the stats_options parameter, the list you used before works here too.\nRemember that to visualize the evaluation statistics you can use tfdv.visualize_statistics().\nHowever, it is impractical to visualize both statistics separately and do your comparison from there. Fortunately, TFDV has got this covered. You can use the visualize_statistics function and pass additional parameters to overlay the statistics from both datasets (referenced as left-hand side and right-hand side statistics). Let’s see what these parameters are:\n\nlhs_statistics: Required parameter. Expects an instance of DatasetFeatureStatisticsList.\nrhs_statistics: Expects an instance of DatasetFeatureStatisticsList to compare with lhs_statistics.\nlhs_name: Name of the lhs_statistics dataset.\nrhs_name: Name of the rhs_statistics dataset.\n\nFor this case, remember to define the lhs_statistics protocol with the eval_stats, and the optional rhs_statistics protocol with the train_stats.\nAdditionally, check the function for the protocol name declaration, and define the lhs and rhs names as 'EVAL_DATASET' and 'TRAIN_DATASET' respectively.\n\n### START CODE HERE\n# Generate evaluation dataset statistics\n# HINT: Remember to use the evaluation dataframe and to pass the stats_options (that you defined before) as an argument\neval_stats = tfdv.generate_statistics_from_dataframe(eval_df, stats_options)\n\n# Compare evaluation data with training data \n# HINT: Remember to use both the evaluation and training statistics with the lhs_statistics and rhs_statistics arguments\n# HINT: Assign the names of 'EVAL_DATASET' and 'TRAIN_DATASET' to the lhs and rhs protocols\ntfdv.visualize_statistics(\n    lhs_statistics=eval_stats, \n    rhs_statistics=train_stats, \n    lhs_name='EVAL_DATASET', \n    rhs_name='TRAIN_DATASET'\n)\n                          \n### END CODE HERE\n\n\n        \n\n\n\n# TEST CODE\n\n# get the number of features used to compute statistics\nprint(f\"Number of features: {len(eval_stats.datasets[0].features)}\")\n\n# check the number of examples used\nprint(f\"Number of examples: {eval_stats.datasets[0].num_examples}\")\n\n# check the column names of the first and last feature\nprint(f\"First feature: {eval_stats.datasets[0].features[0].path.step[0]}\")\nprint(f\"Last feature: {eval_stats.datasets[0].features[-1].path.step[0]}\")\n\nNumber of features: 48\nNumber of examples: 15265\nFirst feature: race\nLast feature: readmitted\n\n\nExpected Output:\nNumber of features: 48\nNumber of examples: 15265\nFirst feature: race\nLast feature: readmitted\n ### Exercise 5: Detecting Anomalies ###\nAt this point, you should ask if your evaluation dataset matches the schema from your training dataset. For instance, if you scroll through the output cell in the previous exercise, you can see that the categorical feature glimepiride-pioglitazone has 1 unique value in the training set while the evaluation dataset has 2. You can verify with the built-in Pandas describe() method as well.\n\ntrain_df[\"glimepiride-pioglitazone\"].describe()\n\ncount     71236\nunique    1    \ntop       No   \nfreq      71236\nName: glimepiride-pioglitazone, dtype: object\n\n\n\neval_df[\"glimepiride-pioglitazone\"].describe()\n\ncount     15265\nunique    2    \ntop       No   \nfreq      15264\nName: glimepiride-pioglitazone, dtype: object\n\n\nIt is possible but highly inefficient to visually inspect and determine all the anomalies. So, let’s instead use TFDV functions to detect and display these.\nYou can use the function tfdv.validate_statistics() for detecting anomalies and tfdv.display_anomalies() for displaying them.\nThe validate_statistics() method has two required arguments: - an instance of DatasetFeatureStatisticsList - an instance of Schema\nFill in the following graded function which, given the statistics and schema, displays the anomalies found.\n\ndef calculate_and_display_anomalies(statistics, schema):\n    '''\n    Calculate and display anomalies.\n\n            Parameters:\n                    statistics : Data statistics in statistics_pb2.DatasetFeatureStatisticsList format\n                    schema : Data schema in schema_pb2.Schema format\n\n            Returns:\n                    display of calculated anomalies\n    '''\n    ### START CODE HERE\n    # HINTS: Pass the statistics and schema parameters into the validation function \n    anomalies =  tfdv.validate_statistics(statistics=statistics, schema=schema)\n    \n    # HINTS: Display input anomalies by using the calculated anomalies\n    tfdv.display_anomalies(anomalies)\n    ### END CODE HERE\n\nYou should see detected anomalies in the medical_specialty and glimepiride-pioglitazone features by running the cell below.\n\n# Check evaluation data for errors by validating the evaluation data staticss using the previously inferred schema\ncalculate_and_display_anomalies(eval_stats, schema=schema)\n\nNo anomalies found.\n\n\n ### Exercise 6: Fix evaluation anomalies in the schema\nThe evaluation data has records with values for the features glimepiride-pioglitazone and medical_speciality that were not included in the schema generated from the training data. You can fix this by adding the new values that exist in the evaluation dataset to the domain of these features.\nTo get the domain of a particular feature you can use tfdv.get_domain().\nYou can use the append() method to the value property of the returned domain to add strings to the valid list of values. To be more explicit, given a domain you can do something like:\ndomain.value.append(\"feature_value\")\n\n### START CODE HERE\n\n# Get the domain associated with the input feature, glimepiride-pioglitazone, from the schema\nglimepiride_pioglitazone_domain = tfdv.get_domain(schema, 'glimepiride-pioglitazone') \nprint(glimepiride_pioglitazone_domain)\n\n# HINT: Append the missing value 'Steady' to the domain\nglimepiride_pioglitazone_domain.value.append('Steady')\nprint(glimepiride_pioglitazone_domain)\n\n# Get the domain associated with the input feature, medical_specialty, from the schema\nmedical_specialty_domain = tfdv.get_domain(schema, 'medical_specialty') \nprint(type(medical_specialty_domain))\n# HINT: Append the missing value 'Neurophysiology' to the domain\nmedical_specialty_domain.value.append('Neurophysiology')\n#print(medical_specialty_domain)\n\n# HINT: Re-calculate and re-display anomalies with the new schema\ncalculate_and_display_anomalies(eval_stats, schema=schema)\n### END CODE HERE\n\nname: \"glimepiride-pioglitazone\"\nvalue: \"No\"\nvalue: \"Steady\"\nvalue: \"Steady\"\nvalue: \"Steady\"\nvalue: \"Steady\"\nvalue: \"Steady\"\n\nname: \"glimepiride-pioglitazone\"\nvalue: \"No\"\nvalue: \"Steady\"\nvalue: \"Steady\"\nvalue: \"Steady\"\nvalue: \"Steady\"\nvalue: \"Steady\"\nvalue: \"Steady\"\n\n&lt;class 'tensorflow_metadata.proto.v0.schema_pb2.StringDomain'&gt;\n\n\nNo anomalies found.\n\n\nIf you did the exercise correctly, you should see “No anomalies found.” after running the cell above.\n ## 6 - Schema Environments\nBy default, all datasets in a pipeline should use the same schema. However, there are some exceptions.\nFor example, the label column is dropped in the serving set so this will be flagged when comparing with the training set schema.\nIn this case, introducing slight schema variations is necessary.\n ### Exercise 7: Check anomalies in the serving set\nNow you are going to check for anomalies in the serving data. The process is very similar to the one you previously did for the evaluation data with a little change.\nLet’s create a new StatsOptions that is aware of the information provided by the schema and use it when generating statistics from the serving DataFrame.\n\n# Define a new statistics options by the tfdv.StatsOptions class for the serving data by passing the previously inferred schema\noptions = tfdv.StatsOptions(schema=schema, \n                            infer_type_from_schema=True, \n                            feature_whitelist=approved_cols)\n\n\n### START CODE HERE\n# Generate serving dataset statistics\n# HINT: Remember to use the serving dataframe and to pass the newly defined statistics options\n#serving_stats = tfdv.generate_statistics_from_dataframe(None, stats_options=None)\nserving_stats = tfdv.generate_statistics_from_dataframe(serving_df, stats_options=options)\n\n# HINT: Calculate and display anomalies using the generated serving statistics\n#calculate_and_display_anomalies(None, schema=None)\ncalculate_and_display_anomalies(serving_stats, schema=schema)\n### END CODE HERE\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAnomaly short description\nAnomaly long description\n\n\nFeature name\n\n\n\n\n\n\n'metformin-pioglitazone'\nUnexpected string values\nExamples contain values missing from the schema: Steady (&lt;1%).\n\n\n'payer_code'\nUnexpected string values\nExamples contain values missing from the schema: FR (&lt;1%).\n\n\n'medical_specialty'\nUnexpected string values\nExamples contain values missing from the schema: DCPTEAM (&lt;1%), Endocrinology-Metabolism (&lt;1%), Resident (&lt;1%).\n\n\n'metformin-rosiglitazone'\nUnexpected string values\nExamples contain values missing from the schema: Steady (&lt;1%).\n\n\n'readmitted'\nColumn dropped\nColumn is completely missing\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nYou should see that metformin-rosiglitazone, metformin-pioglitazone, payer_code and medical_specialty features have an anomaly (i.e. Unexpected string values) which is less than 1%.\nLet’s relax the anomaly detection constraints for the last two of these features by defining the min_domain_mass of the feature’s distribution constraints.\n\n# This relaxes the minimum fraction of values that must come from the domain for the feature.\n\n# Get the feature and relax to match 90% of the domain\npayer_code = tfdv.get_feature(schema, 'payer_code')\npayer_code.distribution_constraints.min_domain_mass = 0.9 \n\n# Get the feature and relax to match 90% of the domain\nmedical_specialty = tfdv.get_feature(schema, 'medical_specialty')\nmedical_specialty.distribution_constraints.min_domain_mass = 0.9 \n\n# Detect anomalies with the updated constraints\ncalculate_and_display_anomalies(serving_stats, schema=schema)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAnomaly short description\nAnomaly long description\n\n\nFeature name\n\n\n\n\n\n\n'metformin-pioglitazone'\nUnexpected string values\nExamples contain values missing from the schema: Steady (&lt;1%).\n\n\n'metformin-rosiglitazone'\nUnexpected string values\nExamples contain values missing from the schema: Steady (&lt;1%).\n\n\n'readmitted'\nColumn dropped\nColumn is completely missing\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIf the payer_code and medical_specialty are no longer part of the output cell, then the relaxation worked!\n ### Exercise 8: Modifying the Domain\nLet’s investigate the possible cause of the anomalies for the other features, namely metformin-pioglitazone and metformin-rosiglitazone. From the output of the previous exercise, you’ll see that the anomaly long description says: “Examples contain values missing from the schema: Steady (&lt;1%)”. You can redisplay the schema and look at the domain of these features to verify this statement.\nWhen you inferred the schema at the start of this lab, it’s possible that some values were not detected in the training data so it was not included in the expected domain values of the feature’s schema. In the case of metformin-rosiglitazone and metformin-pioglitazone, the value “Steady” is indeed missing. You will just see “No” in the domain of these two features after running the code cell below.\n\ntfdv.display_schema(schema)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nType\nPresence\nValency\nDomain\n\n\nFeature

'NO'\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTowards the bottom of the Domain-Values pairs of the cell above, you can see that many features (including ‘metformin’) have the same values: ['Down', 'No', 'Steady', 'Up']. These values are common to many features including the ones with missing values during schema inference.\nTFDV allows you to modify the domains of some features to match an existing domain. To address the detected anomaly, you can set the domain of these features to the domain of the metformin feature.\nComplete the function below to set the domain of a feature list to an existing feature domain.\nFor this, use the tfdv.set_domain() function, which has the following parameters:\n\nschema: The schema\nfeature_path: The name of the feature whose domain needs to be set.\ndomain: A domain protocol buffer or the name of a global string domain present in the input schema.\n\n\ndef modify_domain_of_features(features_list, schema, to_domain_name):\n    '''\n    Modify a list of

schema\n\nUsing this function, set the domain of the features defined in the domain_change_features list below to be equal to metformin’s domain to address the anomalies found.\nSince you are

The readmitted feature (which is the label column) showed up as an anomaly (‘Column dropped’). Since labels are not expected in the serving data, let’s tell TFDV to ignore this detected anomaly.\nThis requirement of introducing slight schema variations can be expressed by using environments. In particular, features in the schema can be associated with a set of environments using default_environment, in_environment and not_in_environment.\n\n# All features are by default in both TRAINING

from the inferred schema and use its not_in_environment attribute to specify that readmitted should be removed from the SERVING environment’s schema. This attribute is a list so you will have to append the name of the environment that you wish to omit this feature for.\nTo be more explicit, given a feature you can do something like:\nfeature.not_in_environment.append('NAME_OF_ENVIRONMENT')\nThe function tfdv.get_feature receives the following parameters:\n\nschema: The schema.\nfeature_path: The path of the feature to obtain from the schema. In this case this is equal to the name of the feature.\n\n\n### START CODE HERE\n# Specify that 'readmitted' feature is not in SERVING environment.\n# HINT: Append the 'SERVING' environmnet to the not_in_environment attribute of the feature\n#tfdv.get_feature(schema, None).not_in_environment.append(None)\nnot_in_environment_feature = tfdv.get_feature(schema,'readmitted').not_in_environment.append('SERVING')\n\n# HINT: Calculate anomalies with the validate_statistics function by using the serving statistics, \n# inferred schema and the SERVING environment parameter.\n#serving_anomalies_with_env = tfdv.validate_statistics(None, schema, environment=None)\nserving_anomalies_with_env = tfdv.validate_statistics(serving_stats, schema, environment=not_in_environment_feature)\n### END CODE HERE\n\nYou should see “No anomalies found” by running the cell below.\n\n# Display anomalies\ntfdv.display_anomalies(serving_anomalies_with_env)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAnomaly short description\nAnomaly long description\n\n\nFeature name\n\n\n\n\n\n\n'readmitted'\nColumn dropped\nColumn is completely missing\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNow you have succesfully addressed all anomaly-related issues!\n ## 7 - Check for Data Drift and Skew\nDuring data validation, you also need to check for data drift and data skew between the training and serving data. You can do this by specifying the skew_comparator and drift_comparator in the schema.\nDrift and skew is expressed in terms of L-infinity distance which evaluates the difference between vectors as the greatest of the differences along any coordinate dimension.\nYou can set the threshold distance so that you receive warnings when the drift is higher than is acceptable. Setting the correct distance is typically an iterative process requiring domain knowledge and experimentation.\nLet’s check for the skew in the diabetesMed feature and drift in the payer_code feature.\n\n# Calculate skew for the diabetesMed feature\ndiabetes_med = tfdv.get_feature(schema, 'diabetesMed')\ndiabetes_med.skew_comparator.infinity_norm.threshold = 0.035 # domain knowledge helps to determine this threshold\n\n# Calculate drift for the payer_code feature\npayer_code = tfdv.get_feature(schema, 'payer_code')\npayer_code.drift_comparator.infinity_norm.threshold = 0.035 # domain knowledge helps to determine this threshold\n\n# Calculate anomalies\nskew_drift_anomalies = tfdv.validate_statistics(train_stats, schema,\n                                          previous_statistics=eval_stats,\n                                          serving_statistics=serving_stats)\n\n# Display anomalies\ntfdv.display_anomalies(skew_drift_anomalies)\n\nNo anomalies found.\n\n\nIn both of these cases, the detected anomaly distance is not too far from the threshold value of 0.03. For this exercise, let’s accept this as within bounds (i.e. you can set the distance to something like 0.035 instead).\nHowever, if the anomaly truly indicates a skew and drift, then further investigation is necessary as this could have a direct impact on model performance.\n ## 8 - Display Stats for Data Slices \nFinally, you can slice the dataset and calculate the statistics for each unique value of a feature. By default, TFDV computes statistics for the overall dataset in addition to the configured slices. Each slice is identified by a unique name which is set as the dataset name in the DatasetFeatureStatistics protocol buffer. Generating and displaying statistics over different slices of data can help track model and anomaly metrics.\nLet’s first define a few helper functions to make our code in the exercise more neat.\n\ndef split_datasets(dataset_list):\n    '''\n    split datasets.\n\n            Parameters:\n                    dataset_list: List of datasets to split\n\n            Returns:\n                    datasets: sliced data\n    '''\n    datasets = []\n    for dataset in dataset_list.datasets:\n        proto_list = DatasetFeatureStatisticsList()\n        proto_list.datasets.extend([dataset])\n        datasets.append(proto_list)\n    return datasets\n\n\ndef display_stats_at_index(index, datasets):\n    '''\n    display statistics at the specified data index\n\n            Parameters:\n                    index : index to show the anomalies\n                    datasets: split data\n\n            Returns:\n                    display of generated sliced data statistics at the specified index\n    '''\n    if index &lt; len(datasets):\n        print(datasets[index].datasets[0].name)\n        tfdv.visualize_statistics(datasets[index])\n\nThe function below returns a list of DatasetFeatureStatisticsList protocol buffers. As shown in the ungraded lab, the first one will be for All Examples followed by individual slices through the feature you specified.\nTo configure TFDV to generate statistics for dataset slices, you will use the function tfdv.StatsOptions() with the following 4 arguments:\n\nschema\nslice_functions passed as a list.\ninfer_type_from_schema set to True.\nfeature_whitelist set to the approved features.\n\nRemember that slice_functions only work with generate_statistics_from_csv() so you will need to convert the dataframe to CSV.\n\ndef sliced_stats_for_slice_fn(slice_fn, approved_cols, dataframe, schema):\n    '''\n    generate statistics for the sliced data.\n\n            Parameters:\n                    slice_fn : slicing definition\n                    approved_cols: list of features to pass to the statistics options\n                    dataframe: pandas dataframe to slice\n                    schema: the schema\n\n            Returns:\n                    slice_info_datasets: statistics for the sliced dataset\n    '''\n    # Set the StatsOptions\n    slice_stats_options = tfdv.StatsOptions(schema=schema,\n                                            slice_functions=[slice_fn],\n                                            infer_type_from_schema=True,\n                                            feature_whitelist=approved_cols)\n    \n    # Convert Dataframe to CSV since `slice_functions` works only with `tfdv.generate_statistics_from_csv`\n    CSV_PATH = 'slice_sample.csv'\n    dataframe.to_csv(CSV_PATH)\n    \n    # Calculate statistics for the sliced dataset\n    sliced_stats = tfdv.generate_statistics_from_csv(CSV_PATH, stats_options=slice_stats_options)\n    \n    # Split the dataset using the previously defined split_datasets function\n    slice_info_datasets = split_datasets(sliced_stats)\n    \n    return slice_info_datasets\n\nWith that, you can now use the helper functions to generate and visualize statistics for the sliced datasets.\n\n# Generate slice function for the `medical_speciality` feature\nslice_fn = slicing_util.get_feature_value_slicer(features={'medical_specialty': None})\n\n# Generate stats for the sliced dataset\nslice_datasets = sliced_stats_for_slice_fn(slice_fn, approved_cols, dataframe=train_df, schema=schema)\n\n# Print name of slices for reference\nprint(f'Statistics generated for:\\n')\nprint('\\n'.join([sliced.datasets[0].name for sliced in slice_datasets]))\n\n# Display at index 10, which corresponds to the slice named `medical_specialty_Gastroenterology`\ndisplay_stats_at_index(1, slice_datasets) \n\nStatistics generated for:\n\nAll Examples\nmedical_specialty_Orthopedics\nmedical_specialty_InternalMedicine\nmedical_specialty_Cardiology\nmedical_specialty_Family/GeneralPractice\nmedical_specialty_Surgery-General\nmedical_specialty_Emergency/Trauma\nmedical_specialty_Nephrology\nmedical_specialty_Surgery-Neuro\nmedical_specialty_Oncology\nmedical_specialty_Gastroenterology\nmedical_specialty_Orthopedics-Reconstructive\nmedical_specialty_ObstetricsandGynecology\nmedical_specialty_Surgery-Cardiovascular/Thoracic\nmedical_specialty_Radiologist\nmedical_specialty_Urology\nmedical_specialty_Surgery-Vascular\nmedical_specialty_Hematology/Oncology\nmedical_specialty_Neurology\nmedical_specialty_Psychology\nmedical_specialty_Psychiatry\nmedical_specialty_PhysicalMedicineandRehabilitation\nmedical_specialty_Pulmonology\nmedical_specialty_Otolaryngology\nmedical_specialty_Obsterics&Gynecology-GynecologicOnco\nmedical_specialty_Endocrinology\nmedical_specialty_Anesthesiology\nmedical_specialty_Pediatrics-Endocrinology\nmedical_specialty_Radiology\nmedical_specialty_Pediatrics\nmedical_specialty_Pediatrics-Pulmonology\nmedical_specialty_Osteopath\nmedical_specialty_Surgery-Plastic\nmedical_specialty_Podiatry\nmedical_specialty_Surgery-Thoracic\nmedical_specialty_Rheumatology\nmedical_specialty_Obstetrics\nmedical_specialty_Pediatrics-AllergyandImmunology\nmedical_specialty_Surgery-Cardiovascular\nmedical_specialty_Anesthesiology-Pediatric\nmedical_specialty_Pathology\nmedical_specialty_Pediatrics-CriticalCare\nmedical_specialty_PhysicianNotFound\nmedical_specialty_Gynecology\nmedical_specialty_AllergyandImmunology\nmedical_specialty_Surgery-Maxillofacial\nmedical_specialty_Hospitalist\nmedical_specialty_Hematology\nmedical_specialty_Surgeon\nmedical_specialty_Proctology\nmedical_specialty_InfectiousDiseases\nmedical_specialty_Psychiatry-Child/Adolescent\nmedical_specialty_SurgicalSpecialty\nmedical_specialty_Ophthalmology\nmedical_specialty_Surgery-Pediatric\nmedical_specialty_Pediatrics-Neurology\nmedical_specialty_Surgery-PlasticwithinHeadandNeck\nmedical_specialty_OutreachServices\nmedical_specialty_Pediatrics-Hematology-Oncology\nmedical_specialty_Dentistry\nmedical_specialty_Pediatrics-EmergencyMedicine\nmedical_specialty_Psychiatry-Addictive\nmedical_specialty_Surgery-Colon&Rectal\nmedical_specialty_Pediatrics-InfectiousDiseases\nmedical_specialty_Dermatology\nmedical_specialty_Perinatology\nmedical_specialty_SportsMedicine\nmedical_specialty_Cardiology-Pediatric\nmedical_specialty_Speech\nmedical_specialty_Orthopedics\n\n\n\n        \n\n\nIf you are curious, try different slice indices to extract the group statistics. For instance, index=5 corresponds to all medical_specialty_Surgery-General records. You can also try slicing through multiple features as shown in the ungraded lab.\nAnother challenge is to implement your own helper functions. For instance, you can make a display_stats_for_slice_name() function so you don’t have to determine the index of a slice. If done correctly, you can just do display_stats_for_slice_name('medical_specialty_Gastroenterology', slice_datasets) and it will generate the same result as display_stats_at_index(10, slice_datasets).\n ## 9 - Freeze the schema\nNow that the schema has been reviewed, you will store the schema in a file in its “frozen” state. This can be used to validate incoming data once your application goes live to your users.\nThis is pretty straightforward using Tensorflow’s io utils and TFDV’s write_schema_text() function.\n\n# Create output directory\nOUTPUT_DIR = \"output\"\nfile_io.recursive_create_dir(OUTPUT_DIR)\n\n# Use TensorFlow text output format pbtxt to store the schema\nschema_file = os.path.join(OUTPUT_DIR, 'schema.pbtxt')\n\n# write_schema_text function expect the defined schema and output path as parameters\ntfdv.write_schema_text(schema, schema_file) \n\nAfter submitting this assignment, you can click the Jupyter logo in the left upper corner of the screen to check the Jupyter filesystem. The schema.pbtxt file should be inside the output directory.\nCongratulations on finishing this week’s assignment! A lot of concepts where introduced and now you should feel more familiar with using TFDV for inferring schemas, anomaly detection and other data-related tasks.\nKeep it up!"

    "text": "Machine Learning Model Monitoring\n\n\n\nMLOps. You Desing It. Your Train It. You Run It.\n\n\n\n\nWhy monitoring matters:\nMachine learning model monitoring is important as it allows to check for changes on the model performance. It is a cyclical and interactive process and need also to consider the monitoring of the infrastructure such as database and application.\nModel monitoring should account for:\n\nData skews\nModel staleness\nNegative feedback loops\n\nFunctional and non-functional monitoring points are:\n\nFunctional:\n\nPredictive peformance\nChanges in serving data\nMetrics used during training\nCharacteristics of features\n\nNon-functional\n\nSystem performance\nSystem status\nSystem reliability\n\n\n\n\nConcepts\n\nData Skew:\nData skews occurs when the model training data is not representative of the live data. There are several reasons for data skew, such as:\n\nTraining data was designed wrong such as the distribution of the features in the training is different from the distribution of the features in real life data.\nFeature not available in production\n\n\n\nModel Staleness\nModel staleness can occur based on:\n\nShifts in the environment as historic data used during model training may change as time progress (e.g. financial models using time of recession might not be effective for predicting default when economy is healthy).\nConsumer behaviour change such as trends in politics, fashion, etc.\nAdversarial scenarios where bad actors (e.g. criminals) seek to weaken the model.\n\n\n\nNegative feedback loops\nNegative feedback loop arises when you train data collected in production that can lead to bias.\n\n\nModel Decay\nProduction ML models often operation in dynamic environments (e.g. recommendation system of clothes need to change over time as the clothes style change over time.\nIf the. Model is static, it will move further away from the truth, issue known as Model drift. Model drift can be split in:\n\nData drift: statistical properties of the input features changes. (e.g. distribution of age feature in a population over time). Real examples here and here.\nConcept drift: occurs when the relationship between the features and labels changes. Examples are prediction drift and label drift. A real example here.\n\n\n\n\nWhat and How to Monitor in ML models:\nWHAT should we monitor in an ML model in production:\n\nModel input distribution\n\nErrors: input values fall within an allowed set/range?\nChanges: does the distribution align with what was seen during training?\n\nModel prediction distribution\n\nStatistical significance: e.g. if variables are normally distributes, we might expect the mean values to be within the standard euro of the mean interval.\n\nModel versions\nInput/prediction correlation\n\nHOW should we monitor it:\n\nTracing your ML model through logging.\n\nObservability of ML model while logging distributed tracings might be challenging.

    "section": "",
    "text": "✨ DeepSeek-R1 and the “aha-moment” ✨\nDeepSeek-R1 is the latest large language model from the Chinese company DeepSeek. This model showcase a significant leap in AI capabilities. Unlike traditional models that rely heavily on supervised fine-tuning (SFT) to get started, DeepSeek-R1 uses large-scale Reinforcement Learning (RL) to boost its reasoning skills. This innovative approach allows DeepSeek-R1 to perform on par with top closed models like OpenAI-o1-1217, without needing extensive pre-training.\nDeepSeek-R1’s multi-stage training pipeline, which includes using cold-start data before RL, sets it apart from its predecessors. By incorporating reasoning tokens during inference, DeepSeek-R1 can generate smarter responses, making it a powerful tool for tackling complex reasoning tasks. This model not only shows the potential of RL in enhancing AI performance but also paves the way for future advancements in the field.\n\nDeepSeek-R1: more intelligence via inference-time scaling through increasing the length of the Chain-of-Though reasoning process.\n\nThe figure below illustrates DeepSeek-R1’s ability to solve complex reasoning tasks by leveraging extended test-time computation. More steps represent more thinking, allowing the model to explore and refine its thought process in greater depth.\n\n\n\nDeepSeek-R1\n\n\n\n🧠 The art of reasoning tokens\nReasoning tokens (also named thinking tokens) enables more intelligence to large models during inference. Until now, the rule to get more intelligent models was only possible through pre-training large model following the “scaling laws”, i.e. adding more training data and computing to pretrain large models.\nNow with the concept of “reasoning tokens” you can achieve more intelligence with the introduction of a model reasoning while doing the next token prediction. This concept has been introduced by Quiet-STaR, OpenAI o1, QnQ and latest DeepSeek-R1.\n\n&lt;|startofthought|&gt; and &lt;|endofthought|&gt; or  as in DeepSeek-R1\n\nThe basic concept is to generate “thinking tokens” at inference time to help model to predict next token. A key challenge is to efficiently generate rationales at each token position in the input sequence.\n\n\n\n\n\n🤔 What is DeepSeek-R1\nDeepSeek-R1 is the based on the DeepSeek-R1-Zero model which is the DeepSeek-v3-base model with large scale RL without SFT. DeepSeek-R1-Zero encountered challenges in relation to poor readability and language mixing. DeepSeek-R1 address this issue by incorporating multi-stage training and cold-start data before RL.\nThe figure below illustrate the main building blocks used to derive DeepSeek-R1.\n\n\n\nDeepSeek-R1 building blocks\n\n\nThe multi-stage pipeline is composed by the following steps:\n\nSeveral thousands of cold-start Chain of Thought (CoT) data to fine-tune the base model.\nReinforcement Learning stage using GPRO and similar to DeepSeek-R1-Zero.\nA SFT through rejection sampling data plus supervised data from DeepSeek-v3 in domains such as writing, factual QA and self-cognition -&gt; ~600k data points.\nAdditional RL with prompts in order to make the model harmless and helpful.\n\nThe cold-start are long Chain-of-through data used to fine-tune the model. Cold-start data brings readability advantages by including a summary at the end of each response and filtering out responses that are no reader-friendly following the pattern: |speacial_token |  | special_token | &lt; summary &gt;.\nThe Reinforced Learning (RL) technique used is named GRPO (Group Relative Policy Optimization). Unlike traditional RL methods which rely heavily on external evaluators (critics) to guide learning, GRPO optimizes the model by evaluating groups of responses relative to one another.\nGRPO mainly uses 2 reward functions:\n\naccuracy rewards: which evaluates whether the response is correct. (e.g. math problem with deterministic results and final answer, unit tests for code as accuracy computation).\nformat rewards: which enforces thinking process by rewarding model if it separates the “thinking” and the “answer” parts by  tags.\n\nThe figure below by Jay Alammar, provides an excellent illustration example of such RL technique using reward signals. More information on GRPO on the paper DeepSeekMath: Pushing the Limits of Mathematical Reasoning in Open Language Models.\n\n\n\nLarge-scale RL by Jay Alammar\n\n\n\n\n💡 The “aha moment” :\nThe model self-evolution through RL indicates its capability to reflect by revisiting and reevaluating previous steps and exploring alternative approaches through problem solving by using extended test-time computing during reasoning.\n\n“The self-evolution process of DeepSeek-R1 is fascinating as it demonstrate how RL can drive the model to improve its reasoning capabilities autonomously. By initiating RL directly from the base model, the author could monitor model progression without the influence of the supervised fine -tuning stage - indicating how model evolves overtime and its ability to handle complex reasoning tasks by leveraging extended test-time computing.”\n\nIn addition to RL, DeepSeek-R1-Zero can be further augmented through the application of majority voting.\n\n\n📝 Rejection sampling and SFT\nRejection sampling and SFT is applied using data from other domains to enhance the model’s capability in writing, role-playing and other general-purpose tasks. For reasoning data this is done using generative reward model with ground-truth and DeepSeek-v3 as a judge (i.e. 600k reasoning training samples in total). For non-reasoning data such as writing, factual QA, self-cognition and translation, the DeepSeek-v3 pipeline is used including reuse of portions of the SFT dataset of DeepSeek-v3 (200k training samples in total).\n\n\n🌐 RL for all scenarios\nRL is used to further align the model with human preferences through a secondary RL stage to improve model helpfulness and harmlessness. Rule-based rewards is used to guide the learn process in math, code and logical reasoning domains, using the same distribution of preference pairs and training prompts used by DeepSeek-v3 pipeline.\n\n\n🧪 Distilled Models: \nFine-tuning is used as a distillation method to empower small models with reason capabilities like DeepSeek-R1. DeepSeek released 6 dense models (1.5B - 70B range) based on Qwen/Llama and distilled from DeepSeek-R1 using 800k curated samples. For distilled modes only SFT is applied (no RL stage included).\n\n\n🔍 Other interesting points:\n\nDespite advocating that model distillation are both economical and effective methods, the DeepSeek’s authors highlight that advancements beyond the boundaries of intelligence may still require powerful base models and large-scale RL.\nMonte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS), which is used by AlphaGo and AlphaZero, has also been proposed as a technique to enhance test-time compute scalability. But DeepSeek’s authors has seen scaling limitation during training as token generation presents an exponentially large search space compared to chess.\nDeepSeek-v3-base is used as the base model for DeepSeek-R1 and follows a Mixture of Expert (MoE) architecture. It has 671 billion parameters where 37 billion is activated for each token. See my previous post Understanding Mixture of Expert for additional information on MoE architectures.\nDeepSeek-v3-base uses Multi-Head Latent Attention (MLA) as its attention mechanism. MLA proposes a low-rank joint compression for the attention keys and values in order to reduce KV (Key-Value) cache during inference. See the Multi-Head Latent Attention section in my post The Power of Focus: Understanding Attention Mechanisms in LLM for more information and references.\n\n\n\n🚀 Conclusion: The Future Implications of DeepSeek-R1 in AI\nDeepSeek-R1 shows how large-scale Reinforcement Learning (RL) can improve reasoning without extensive supervised fine-tuning (SFT). By using multi-stage training and cold-start data, DeepSeek-R1 matches the performance of top models.\nKey points highlighted in this article include:\n\nMulti-stage Training: Combining cold-start data, RL, and SFT to enhance the model.\nReinforcement Learning: Using Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) to improve responses.\nReasoning Tokens: Generating “thinking tokens” to boost reasoning.\nSelf-Evolution: The model improves itself through RL.\nDistilled Models: Smaller models gain similar reasoning abilities through fine-tuning.\n\nDeepSeek-R1’s success highlights the potential of RL and reasoning tokens for creating smarter AI. This model opens new possibilities for AI applications in various fields, from language processing to decision-making.\n\n\n📚References:\n\nDeepSeek-R1 Technical Report\nDeepSeek-R1: Incentivizing Reasoning Capability in LLMs via Reinforcement Learning by DeepSeek-AI\nThe Math Behind DeepSeek: A Deep Dive into Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) by Ahmed\nThe Ilustrated DeepSeek-R1 by Jay Alammar\nQuiet-STaR: Language Models Can Teach Themselves to Think Before Speaking\n\n\n[!TIP]\nFor a fully open reproduction of DeepSeek-R1, check Open R1 project by Hugging Face.\nBy the way you can use the DeepSeek’s AI assistant app in the Apple App Store."

FlashAttention-2].\nTo reduce computational requirement of attention on such long context, techniques such as FlashAttention has been proposed to reorder the attention computation and leverages classical techniques such as tilling and recomputation, to speed up and reduce memory usage from quadratic to linear in sequence length (2-4x faster than a standard attention implementation).\nTo check the list of flash attention adopters, check https://github.com/Dao-AILab/flash-attention/blob/main/usage.md\nBefore diving into Flash Attention we need to introduce the GPU hardware characteristics\n\nGPU Hardware Characteristics\nMain components of a modern GPU are:\n\nOn-chip SRAM (a.k.a. as shared memory e.g. A100 19TB/s - 192KB per 108 streaming)\nHBM (High Bandwidth Memory) (e.g. A100 - 40-80GB and 1.5-2.0TB/s )\nSM (streaming multiprocessor) (e.g. A100 - 108 stream multiprocessors )\n\n1 SM - 1 Thread block -&gt; Warp (1 warp - 32 threads)\n\n\n\nPicture By DeepLearning Hero.

Threads are organized into thread blocks, which are scheduled to run on streaming mutiprocessors (SMs)\nWithin each thread blocks, threads are grouped into warps ( 1 warp equal 3 threads). Threads within a warp can communicate by fast shuffe instructions or cooperate to perform matrix multiply.\nWarps within a thread block can communicate by reading from and writing to shared memory. Each kernel loads inputs from HBM to registers and SRAM, computes, then writes outputs to HBM.\n\n\n\nimage-20240506135327900\n\n\nPicture By DeepLearning Hero.

This reduction in memory reads/writes brings significant speedup (2-4x) in most cases. [ref. https://www.adept.ai/blog/flashier-attention]\nThe figure below is from FlashAttention paper showing on the left that FlashAttention uses tiling to prevent materialization of the large 𝑁 × 𝑁 attention matrix (dotted box) on (relatively) slow GPU HBM.\nHere in the outer loop (red arrows), FlashAttention loops through blocks of the K and V matrices and loads them to fast on-chip SRAM. In each block, FlashAttention loops over blocks of Q matrix (blue arrows), loading them to SRAM, and writing the output of the attention computation back to HBM.\nOn the right you see the speedup over the PyTorch implementation of attention on GPT-2. FlashAttention does not read and write the large 𝑁 × 𝑁 attention matrix to HBM, resulting in an 7.6× speedup on the attention computation according to the paper.\n\n\n\nimage-20240507155528488\n\n\n\n\nFlashAttention at PyTorch\nPyTorch implements flash attention (https://pytorch.org/docs/stable/generated/torch.nn.functional.scaled_dot_product_attention.html).\nRef. code snipped example below from DeepLearning Hero.\nwith torch.backends.cuda.sdp_kernel(\n        enable_flash=False, enable_math=True, enable_mem_efficient=True\n):\nCheck https://marcelcastrobr.github.io/ for a notebook implementation.\nReferences:\n\n[Ref 0] FlashAttention: Fast and Memory-Efficient Exact Attention with IO-Awareness - https://arxiv.org/abs/2205.14135\n[Ref1] FlashAttention-2: Faster Attention with Better Parallelism and Work Partitioning https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.08691\n[Ref2] Matrix Multiplication: Inner Product, Outer Product & Systolic Array https://www.adityaagrawal.net/blog/architecture/matrix_multiplication\n[ref3] Benchmarking and Dissecting the Nvidia Hopper GPU Architecture https://arxiv.org/pdf/2402.13499v1\n[ref4] NVIDIA Hopper Architecture In-Depth https://developer.nvidia.com/blog/nvidia-hopper-architecture-in-depth/\n[ref5] FlashAttention: Fast Transformer training with long sequences https://www.adept.ai/blog/flashier-attention\n[ref6] AWS Broadcast https://broadcast.amazon.com/videos/670513?ref=personal\n[ref.7] Andrej Karpathy implementation - https://twitter.com/karpathy/status/1786461447654125625?s=51"

When managed inefficiently, this memory can be significantly wasted by fragmentation and redundant duplication, limiting the batch size.\nPageAttention propose to improve the LLM throughput by batching multiple requests together. Thus to process many requests in a batch needs an efficient memory management.\nAs discussed in [Ref 0] , approximately 65% of memory is allocated to mode weights which are static parameters during serving (considing a 13B LLM on NVIDIA A100 GPU with 40GB RAM). Close to 30% of the memory is used to store the dynamic states of the requests (a.k.a KV cache). The remaining memore is used for other data such as activations.\nSince model weights are constant and the activations only occupy a small fraction of the GPU memory, the way KV cache if managed is critical in determinig the maximum batch size.\n\nPicture from Paper Efficient Memory Management for Large Language Model Serving with PagedAttention. In the Left: Memory layout when serving an LLM with 13B parameters on NVIDIA A100. The parameters (gray) persist in GPU memory throughout serving. The memory for the KV cache (red) is (de)allocated per serving request. A small amount of memory (yellow) is used ephemerally for activation. Right: vLLM smooths out the rapid growth curve of KV cache memory seen in existing systems [31, 60], leading to a notable boost in serving throughput.\nPageAttention solution is inspired by the operating system solution to memory fragmentation and sharing: virtual memory with paging. KV cache is divided into blocks, where the blocks are not necessarly stored in contiguous space (i.e. think blocks as pages, tokens as bytes and requests as processes). This allows PagedAttention to achieve:\n\nnear-zero waste in KV cache memory.\nflexible sharing of KV cache within and across requests to further reduce memory usage.\n\nReferences:\n[Ref 0] [Efficient Memory Management for Large Language Model Serving with PagedAttention - https://arxiv.org/pdf/2309.06180]"

    "text": "Quantization\nBackgroun problem: Larger models but reduce memory capacity on accelerators.\n\n\n\nimage-20240422115546209\n\n\nSource: Deeplearning.ai course here\nKey facts:\n\nyou can quantize the model weights and activations\n\nExample:\n\n\n\nimage-20240422120051189\n\n\n\nFloating Point\nFloating point is defined by three components:\n\nSign: positive/negative (1 bit)\nExponent (range): impact the representable range of the number\nFraction (precision): impact on the precision of the number\n\nDowncasting: Loss of data due to the convertion of higher data type (e.g. float) to a lower data type (integer)\nAdvantages of Downcasting is:\n\nreduce memory footprint: more efficient use of memory, enable training of larger models and largers batch sizes\nincrease compute and speed: low precision (fp16, bf16) can be faster than fp32 since it uses less memory.\n\nBut disadvantages comes to the less precise computation.\nUsecase for Downcasting are:\n\ndo computation in smaller precison and store and update the weights in higher precision.\n\n\n\nPrecision Format\nSize of the model is determined by the number of its parameters and their precision.\nBased on IEEE standard for floating point arithmetics, it is common convention to represent numbers in binary using 64bits for double-precision, 32 bits for single-precision and 16 bits for half-precision. In ML jargon FP32 is called full-precision (4 bytes) and FP16 are refered as half-precison (2 bytes).\nFor example, the float16 (FP16) data type, 5 bits are reserved for exponent (range) and 10 bits are reserved for mantissa (precision/fraction) and 1 bit for sign of the number. Compared to FP32, the FP36 has a much lower range exposing it to the risk of overflowing (i.e. trying to represent a number that is very large) and underflowing (i.e. trying to represent a number that is very small).\n\n\n\nimage-20230509074147204\n\n\n\n\n\nimage-20240422121320403\n\n\n\n\n\nimage-20240422121351859\n\n\nExample below from Coursera course: Generative AI with LLMs.\n\n\n\nimage-20230702151132607\n\n\n\n\n\nimage-20230702151239388\n\n\nNice to know: Using the pi constant 3.14 E0, the 3.14 is the precision and E0 the range Thus for FP16 we can have range of 2** 5 and precision of 2 **10.\n\n\n\nimage-20230509081209750\n\n\n\nFull and Half Precision in ML\nSince FP32 is 2 times slower than FP16, a mixed precision approach is used in ML, where the weights are held in FP32 as a precise main weights reference and forward and backward pass are done for FP16/BF16 to enhance training speed. Thus the FP16 gradients are used to update the FP32 main weights.\nCalculating Model Size\nTo calculate model size in bytes, you need to multiply the number of parameters by the size of the chosen precision in bytes. E.g. using BF16 version of BLOOM-176B model we will need 176E9  2 bytes = 352GBytes.\nThus we need a few GPUs to do inference using Bloom-176B. But, luckily we can store the weights with less memory using different data types –&gt; technique called quantization. Two common 8-bit quantizations techniques are zero-pointy quantization and absolute maximum (absmax) quantization.\n\n\nModel Quantization\n\n\n\nimage-20240422123407667\n\n\nExample from fp32 to bf16:\n\n\n\nimage-20240422124540042\n\n\n8-bit quantization method used a quarter precision, then reducing the model to 1/4th of its original size. Quantization is done by “rounding” from one data type to another. However this might lead to information loss (i.e. lossy compression)\nLLM.int8() is an example of quantization implemented by HuggingFace Transformers. To achieve zero degradation matrix multiplication for LLM, LLM.int8() remove the performance deterioration caused by outlier features by identifying the outliers from the input hidden states and multiplying it in FP16 and non-outliers in int8.\nA side effect of this quantization is the the model can suffer performance degradtion (15% to 23% slower than the FP16)\n\n\nMemory Usage\nFalcon Models\n\n\n\nModel\nLayers\nd_model\nHead_dim\nVocabulary\nSequence length\nHardware\nGPU Memory required\nPretraining length [tokens]\nPretraining compute [PF-days]\nK,V-cache size for a 2.048 context\n\n\n\n\ntiiuae/falcon-40b-instruct\n60\n8192\n64\n65024\n2048\n64 A100 40GB in p4d.\n~90GB\n1.0 Trillion\n2800\n20MB\n\n\ntiiuae/falcon-7b-instruct\n32\n4544\n64\n65024\n2048\n32 A100 40GB GPUs in P4d.\n~15GB\n1.5 Trillion\n700\n240MB\n\n\n\nAWS Instances:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nInstance\nMemory\nvCPUs\nGPUs\nGPU Memory\nGPU Model\nStorage\nPrice\n\n\n\n\ng5.12xlarge\n192GB\n48vCPU\n4\n96GiB\nNVIDIA A10G\n3800GB NVMe SSD\n$6.3317 hourly\n\n\ng5.48xlarge\n768GB\n192vCPU\n8\n192GiB\nNVIDIA A10G\n7600GB\n$18.1823 hourly\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nReference:\n\nQuantization by HuggingFace"

    "text": "The attention mechanism is an operator that was introduced as part of the Transformer architecture by the paper entitled “Attention is All You Need”.\nAs highligthed by Attention Mechanisms and Transformers, the intuition behind attention is that rather than compressing the input, it might be better for the decoder to revisit the input sequence at every step.\nMoreover, rather than always seeing the same representation of the input, one might imagine that the decoder should selectively focus on particular parts of the input sequence at particular decoding steps.\nThe high-level idea is that the encoder could produce a representation of length equal to the original input sequence. Then, at decoding time, the decoder can (via some control mechanism) receive as input a context vector consisting of a weighted sum of the representations on the input at each time step. Intuitively, the weights determine the extent to which each step’s context “focuses” on each input token, and the key is to make this process for assigning the weights differentiable so that it can be learned along with all of the other neural network parameters.\nThis notebook was created to better understand the attention mechanism in Transformers using PyTorch. The code examples here are inspired by Let’s build GPT: from scratch, in code, spelled out by Andrej Karpathy.\n\n\n\nPython knowledge\nPyTorch\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nimage-attention\n\n\nThe main components of the attention mechanism by Transfomers are: - q: query vector - k: key vector - v: values vector\n\n\n\n# Mathematical trick of self-attention\n\nimport torch\nimport torch.nn as nn\nfrom torch.nn import functional as F\n\n# toy example illustrating how matrix multiplication can be used for a \"weighted aggregation\"\ntorch.manual_seed(42)\na = torch.tril(torch.ones(3, 3))\na = a / torch.sum(a, 1, keepdim=True)\nb = torch.randint(0,10,(3,2)).float()\nc = a @ b\nprint('a=')\nprint(a)\nprint('--')\nprint('b=')\nprint(b)\nprint('--')\nprint('c=')\nprint(c)\n\na=\ntensor([[1.0000, 0.0000, 0.0000],\n        [0.5000, 0.5000, 0.0000],\n        [0.3333, 0.3333, 0.3333]])\n--\nb=\ntensor([[2., 7.],\n        [6., 4.],\n        [6., 5.]])\n--\nc=\ntensor([[2.0000, 7.0000],\n        [4.0000, 5.5000],\n        [4.6667, 5.3333]])\n\n\n\n# consider the following toy example:\n\ntorch.manual_seed(1337)\nB,T,C = 4,8,2 # batch, time, channels -&gt; 8 tokens in a batch with 2 dimension each.\nx = torch.randn(B,T,C)\nx.shape\n\ntorch.Size([4, 8, 2])\n\n\nIn this example we assume auto regressive model (decoder only transformers). That means each token t only consider the previous tokens t-1, t-2, etc. Example: Token in the 5th location should only talk to tolken in the 4th, 3rd, 2nd and 1st location.\nThe code below is using bag-of-words (bow) to implement the auto regressive - considering average of previous tokens using torch.mean.\n\n# We want x[b,t] = mean_{i&lt;=t} x[b,i]\nxbow = torch.zeros((B,T,C))\nfor b in range(B):\n    for t in range(T):\n        xprev = x[b,:t+1] # (t,C)\n        xbow[b,t] = torch.mean(xprev, 0)\n\nx[0]\n\ntensor([[ 0.1808, -0.0700],\n        [-0.3596, -0.9152],\n        [ 0.6258,  0.0255],\n        [ 0.9545,  0.0643],\n        [ 0.3612,  1.1679],\n        [-1.3499, -0.5102],\n        [ 0.2360, -0.2398],\n        [-0.9211,  1.5433]])\n\n\n\n# Now xbow represents the tokens averaged by previous tokens.\nxbow[0] \n# Example: token -0.0894, -0.4926 is an average of [[ 0.1808, -0.0700],[-0.3596, -0.9152]]\n\ntensor([[ 0.1808, -0.0700],\n        [-0.0894, -0.4926],\n        [ 0.1490, -0.3199],\n        [ 0.3504, -0.2238],\n        [ 0.3525,  0.0545],\n        [ 0.0688, -0.0396],\n        [ 0.0927, -0.0682],\n        [-0.0341,  0.1332]])\n\n\nUsing matrix multiplation is a more efficient method compared to the for-loops.\n\n# Let´s take the example of A (3x3) x B(3x2) = C(3x2)\n\ntorch.manual_seed(42)\na = torch.ones(3,3)\nb = torch.randint(0,10,(3,2)).float()\nc = a @ b # Matrix multiplication in pytorch\nprint('a=')\nprint(a)\nprint('b=')\nprint(b)\nprint('c=')\nprint(c)\nprint('c-shape=')\nprint(c.shape)\n\na=\ntensor([[1., 1., 1.],\n        [1., 1., 1.],\n        [1., 1., 1.]])\nb=\ntensor([[2., 7.],\n        [6., 4.],\n        [6., 5.]])\nc=\ntensor([[14., 16.],\n        [14., 16.],\n        [14., 16.]])\nc-shape=\ntorch.Size([3, 2])\n\n\n\n# Using torch.tril -&gt; lower tringular part of a matrix (i.e. my diagonal matrix in calculus :-) )\ntorch.manual_seed(42)\na = torch.tril(torch.ones(3,3))\na = a / torch.sum(a, 1, keepdim=True) # weighted aggregation\nb = torch.randint(0,10,(3,2)).float()\nc = a @ b # Matrix multiplication in pytorch\nprint('a=')\nprint(a)\nprint('b=')\nprint(b)\nprint('c=')\nprint(c)\nprint('c-shape=')\nprint(c.shape)\n\na=\ntensor([[1.0000, 0.0000, 0.0000],\n        [0.5000, 0.5000, 0.0000],\n        [0.3333, 0.3333, 0.3333]])\nb=\ntensor([[2., 7.],\n        [6., 4.],\n        [6., 5.]])\nc=\ntensor([[2.0000, 7.0000],\n        [4.0000, 5.5000],\n        [4.6667, 5.3333]])\nc-shape=\ntorch.Size([3, 2])\n\n\n\n\nxbow2 is the matrix multiplation of weight aggregation using weighted sums.\n\n# version 2: using matrix multiply for a weighted aggregation\nwei = torch.tril(torch.ones(T, T)) # wei == weights\nwei = wei / wei.sum(1, keepdim=True)\nxbow2 = wei @ x # (B, T, T) @ (B, T, C) ----&gt; (B, T, C)\n\ntorch.allclose(xbow, xbow2)\nprint('wei.shape:')\nprint(wei.shape)\nprint('x.shape:')\nprint(x.shape)\nprint('xbow2.shape:')\nprint(xbow2.shape)\n\nwei.shape:\ntorch.Size([8, 8])\nx.shape:\ntorch.Size([4, 8, 2])\nxbow2.shape:\ntorch.Size([4, 8, 2])\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFor lower triangle matix (a.k.a diagnoal matrix) we use torch.marked_fill to change 0 values to -inf.

In current LLMs this is in the order of &gt;1500 dimensions.\nIn the example below we see a single head self attention.\nSimple and nice explanation of Q, K and V by Andrej:\nEvery single token has 2 vectors: query and key.\nQuery (Q) vector represents “what I am lookig for”.\nKey (K) vector represents “What do I contain”.\nThus afinity between tokens is the .dot product between query and key and becomes wei (weights).\nHere head_size is a hyperparameter.\nScaled Dot Product Attention (SDPA) is a component of the multi head attention and it is defines as \nwhere Q,K,V stand for queries, keys and values, and d is the dimension (head_size hyperparameter below) of the queries/keys.\nBelow is the SDPA implementation by Andrej Karpathy.\n\n# version 4: self-attention!\ntorch.manual_seed(1337)\nB,T,C = 4,8,32 # batch, time, channels\nx = torch.randn(B,T,C)\n\n# let's see a single Head perform self-attention\nhead_size = 16\nkey = nn.Linear(C, head_size, bias=False)\nquery = nn.Linear(C, head_size, bias=False) # applies matrix multiply.\nvalue = nn.Linear(C, head_size, bias=False) # applies matrix multiply.\nk = key(x)   # (B, T, 16)\nq = query(x) # (B, T, 16)\nwei =  q @ k.transpose(-2, -1) # (B, T, 16) @ (B, 16, T) ---&gt; (B, T, T) transpose only last two dimensions.\n\n# Now wei (weights) contains the relationship between tokens.\ntril = torch.tril(torch.ones(T, T))\n#wei = torch.zeros((T,T))\nwei = wei.masked_fill(tril == 0, float('-inf'))\nwei = F.softmax(wei, dim=-1)  # exponentiate and normalize\n\nv = value(x) # v aggregate info for the single head.\nout = wei @ v\n#out = wei @ x\n\nout.shape\n\ntorch.Size([4, 8, 16])\n\n\nFigure below shows the SDPA operations performed in the code above.

With a single attention head, averaging inhibits this.\nThus multi-head attention linearly projects the queries, keys and values h (number of heads) times with different, learned linear projections to q, k and v dimensions, respectively.\n\n\n\nsdpa\n\n\nThe mathematical representation of multi-head attention is\n\n\n\nsdpa\n\n\nIn PyTorch the implementation of multi-head attention can be found in torch.nn.MultiHeadAttention.\n\n\n\nImportant remarks from Andrej:\n\nAttention is a communication mechanism. Can be seen as nodes in a directed graph looking at each other and aggregating information with a weighted sum from all nodes that point to them, with data-dependent weights.\nThere is no notion of space. Attention simply acts over a set of vectors. This is why we need to positionally encode tokens.\nEach example across batch dimension is of course processed completely independently and never “talk” to each other\n“self-attention” just means that the keys and values are produced from the same source as queries. In “cross-attention”, the queries still get produced from x, but the keys and values come from some other, external source (e.g. an encoder module)\n“Scaled” attention additional divides wei by 1/sqrt(head_size). This makes it so when input Q,K are unit variance, wei will be unit variance too and Softmax will stay diffuse and not saturate too much.\n\n\n\n\n\nLet’s build GPT: from scratch, in code, spelled out by Andrej Karpathy and notebook\nUnderstanding Multi-Head Attention for ML Framework Developers\n11.

    "text": "Important remarks from Andrej:\n\nAttention is a communication mechanism. Can be seen as nodes in a directed graph looking at each other and aggregating information with a weighted sum from all nodes that point to them, with data-dependent weights.\nThere is no notion of space. Attention simply acts over a set of vectors. This is why we need to positionally encode tokens.\nEach example across batch dimension is of course processed completely independently and never “talk” to each other\n“self-attention” just means that the keys and values are produced from the same source as queries. In “cross-attention”, the queries still get produced from x, but the keys and values come from some other, external source (e.g. an encoder module)\n“Scaled” attention additional divides wei by 1/sqrt(head_size). This makes it so when input Q,K are unit variance, wei will be unit variance too and Softmax will stay diffuse and not saturate too much."
