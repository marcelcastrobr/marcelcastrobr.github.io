Most of the code is based on the Coursera course Generative Deep Learning with TensorFlow by Laurence Moroney and Eddy Shyu.
Check notebook here.
Fast Neural Style Transfer Paper describing Fast Neural Style Transfer can be found here.
The model is provided by Tensorflow Hub.
Figure below illustrate the main concept of Neural Style Transfer, which is based on the paper A Neural Algorithm of Artistic Style (Gatys, Ecker &amp;amp; Bethge, 2015).</description></item></channel></rss>
